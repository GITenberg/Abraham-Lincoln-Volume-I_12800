<h2>EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The fifth and final group of biographies in the
American Statesmen series deals with the Period
of the Civil War. The statesmen whose lives are
included in this group are Abraham Lincoln,
William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Charles
Francis Adams, Charles Sumner, and Thaddeus
Stevens.</p>

<hr class='short'/>

<p>The years of the civil war constitute an episode
rather than an independent period in our national
history. They were interposed between two eras;
and if they are to be integrally connected with
either of these, it is with the era which preceded
them rather than with that which followed them.
They were the result, the closing act, of the quarter-century
of the anti-slavery crusade. When
the war came to an end the country made a new
start under new conditions. Yet it is proper to
treat the years of the war by themselves, not only
because they were filled by the clearly defined and
abnormal condition of warfare, but because a distinct
group of statesmen is peculiarly associated
with them. The men whose lives are found in
<!-- Image No 8 --><a name='Png008'></a><a name='Page_vi'></a><span class="pagenum">vi</span>
this group had been struggling for recognition
during the years which preceded the war, but they
only arrived at the control of affairs after that
event became assured. Soon after its close their
work was substantially done.</p>

<p>For a long while before hostilities actually broke
out, it was evident that a civil war would be a
natural result of the antagonism between the
South and the North; it is now obvious enough
that it was more than a natural, that it was an
absolutely inevitable result. Looking backward,
we can only be surprised that wise men ever fancied
that a conflict could be avoided; but, as
usual, the strenuous hope became father to an anxious
belief. Abraham Lincoln, in the first year
when he gave indication of his political clear-sightedness,
said truly that the country could not continue
half slave and half free. That truth involved
war. There was no other possible way to settle
the question between the two halves; talk of freeing
the slaves by purchase, or by gradual emancipation
and colonization, was simple nonsense,
the forlorn schemes of men who would fain have
escaped out of the track of inexorable destiny.
Yet the vast majority of the nation, appalled at
the vision of the great fact which lay right athwart
their road, was obstinate in the delusive expectation
of flanking it, as though there were side paths
<!-- Image No 9 --><a name='Png009'></a><a name='Page_vii'></a><span class="pagenum">vii</span>
whereby mankind can circumvent fate and walk
around that which <i>must be</i>, just as if it were not.
Thus it came to pass that when the South seceded,
as every intelligent man ought to have been perfectly
sure would be the case, a confusion fell for
a time upon the North. In that section of the
country there was for a few months a spectacle
which has no parallel in history. There was paralysis,
there was disintegration; worse than either,
there was an utter lack of straight sense and clear
thought. There were politicians, editors, writers,
agitators, reformers in multitudes whose reiteration
of their moral convictions, whose intense addresses
and uncompromising articles, had for years been
bringing about precisely this event; yet when it
came, it appeared that no one of them had contemplated
it with any realizing appreciation, no one
of them was ready for it, no one of them had any
sensible, practical course of action to recommend.
There was no union among them, no cohesion of
opinion or of purpose, no agreement of forecast;
each had his own individual notion as to what
could be done, what should be done, what would be
the train of events. Politically speaking, society
was a mere parcel of units, with topical proximity,
but with no other element of aggregation. The immensity
of the crisis seemed to shake men's minds;
the enigma of duty involved such possibilities, in
<!-- Image No 10 --><a name='Png010'></a><a name='Page_viii'></a><span class="pagenum">viii</span>

case of a wrong solution, that the wisest leaders,
becoming dazed and overawed, uttered the grossest
follies. Men who had been energetic and vigorous
before, when they were pursuing a purpose, who
became so again afterward, when the distinct issue
had taken shape, now lost for a time their intellectual
self-possession. The picture of the country
during three or four months, or rather an observant
study of the prominent men of the country, is sufficiently
interesting historically, but is vastly more
so psychologically. I know of no other period in
history in which this peculiar element of interest
exists to anywhere near an equal degree. It is
the study of human nature which for a brief time
absorbs us, much more than the study of events.</p>

<p>But this condition was, by its nature, transitory.
Events moved, and soon created defined and clean-cut
issues, in relation to which individuals were
compelled to find their positions,&mdash;positions where
they could establish a belief, whether that belief
should prove at last to be right or wrong; positions
wherein they were willing to abide to the end,
be that end victory or ruin. Primarily everything
depended upon Abraham Lincoln. If he should
prove to be a weak man, like his predecessor, or
if he should prove to be a man of merely ordinary
capacity and character like the presidents who had
followed Van Buren, then all was over for the
<!-- Image No 11 --><a name='Png011'></a><a name='Page_ix'></a><span class="pagenum">ix</span>

North. With what anxiety, with how much doubt,
the people of the Northern States scanned their
singular and untried choice can never be fully appreciated
by persons who cannot remember those
wearisome, overladen days. He was an unknown
quantity in the awful problem. In his debates
with Douglas he had given some indication of
what was in him, but outside of Illinois not one
man in a hundred was familiar with those debates.
Nor did even they furnish conclusive proof
of his administrative capacity, especially in these
days of novel and mortal stress. For a time he
seemed to wait, to drift; until the day of his inauguration
he gave no sign; then in his speech the
people, whose hearts were standing still in their
eagerness to hear, found reassuring sentences. Yet
nothing seemed to follow during many anxious
weeks; the suns rose and the suns set, and still the
leader raised no standard around which the people
could rally, uttered no inspiring word of command
which could unite the dissevered political cliques.
What was in his mind all this while can never be
known, though no knowledge could be more interesting.
Was he in a simple attitude of expectancy,
awaiting the march of events, watchful for some
one of them to give him the cue as well as the opportunity
for action? Many believe that this was
the case; and if it was, no other course could have
<!-- Image No 12 --><a name='Png012'></a><a name='Page_x'></a><span class="pagenum">x</span>
been more intelligent. In due time events came
which brought decision with them, the crisis shaped
itself, and he was ready with clear and prompt
action. When it was known what he would do,
matters were settled. The people, once assured
that the fight would be made, entered upon it with
such a temper and in possession of such resources
that, in spite of those trying fluctuations which
any wise man could have foreseen, they were sure
in the end to win.</p>

<p>It would be out of place in these prefatory paragraphs,
to attempt any skeleton picture of the
momentous struggle. I believe that the story is
told very completely in the lives which compose
this group. The statesmen who controlled events
during the war were a new group; they were not
young men, neither were they unknown or untried
in public affairs; but they were for the first time
in control. In their younger days they had been
under the shadow and predominance of the old
school of statesmen, whose object had been to prevent,
or at least to defer indefinitely, precisely that
crisis which was now present. They themselves,
on the other hand, had been strenuously advocating
the policies which had at last brought that crisis
into existence. But the election of Abraham Lincoln
was their first, and as yet their only triumph.
In all previous trials of strength they had been
<!-- Image No 13 --><a name='Png013'></a><a name='Page_xi'></a><span class="pagenum">xi</span>
defeated. Their present success was like the
bursting of a torrent through a dam. At the instant
when they attained it they found themselves
involved in a political swirl and clash of momentous
difficulties. It was a tremendous test to which
they were being subjected. The part which Lincoln
played, at their head, I have endeavored to
depict in his life. The manner in which he controlled
without commanding, his rare combination
of confidence in his own judgment with entire absence
of self-assertion, his instinctive appreciation
of the meaning and bearing of facts, his capacity
to recognize the precise time until which action
should be postponed and then to know that action
must be taken, suggesting the idea of prescience,
his long-suffering and tolerance towards impolitic,
obstructive, or over-rash individuals, his marvelous
gift of keeping in touch with the people, form a
group of qualities which, united in the President
of the United States at that mortal juncture, are
as strong evidence as anything which this generation
has seen to corroborate a faith in an overruling
Providence. Conceive what might have
happened if it had been some other of our presidents
who had happened to have his term begin
in 1861! Yet, after all the study that can be
made of him, there are unexplainable elements in
Lincoln's character which will leave him forever
<!-- Image No 14 --><a name='Png014'></a><a name='Page_xii'></a><span class="pagenum">xii</span>
an enigma. If the world ever settles down to the
acceptance of any definite, accurate picture of
him, it will surely be a false picture. There must
always be vague, indefinable uncertainties in any
presentation of him which shall be truly made.</p>

<p>Of the men who labored with him, I have left
myself room to say little, nor need much be said
here. Their lives tell their stories. Taken together,
these biographies contain the history, upon
the civil side, of the war period. Seward represents
the policy of the administration as a whole,
for all civil business centred in the office of the
secretary of state. He was a man of extraordinary
ability. It is true that he made a strange blunder
or two, at the outset, odd episodes in his intelligent,
clear-sighted, cool-headed career,&mdash;psychologically
interesting, as has been suggested; but he
immediately recovered himself and settled down
to that course of wise statesmanship which was
justly to be expected of him.</p>

<p>Chase handled the finances of the country with
brilliant success. People have criticised him, especially
have said that his legal-tender scheme was a
needless and mischievous measure. But his task
was immeasurably difficult, and he had to act with
great promptitude, having little time for consideration,
obliged to provide instantly for immediate
exigencies, forced to respect the present state of
<!-- Image No 15 --><a name='Png015'></a><a name='Page_xiii'></a><span class="pagenum">xiii</span>
feeling among the moneyed classes, though it might
be transitory, and to be controlled by the possibilities
of the passing moment. He met the gigantic
daily outlay without even a temporary interruption,
and the country grew rich, not only nominally in
an inflated currency, but actually in a great development
of material resources, beneath his management
of the treasury. To find fault with him,
and to talk of the &quot;<i>might have been</i>&quot; seems unworthy;
also unsatisfactory, since the consequences
of a different policy are wholly matter of supposition.</p>

<p>Charles Sumner, the preacher of the crusade,
stands for the moral element. Possibly his most important
work came before the war. But the prestige
which he had gained made him a man to be
reckoned with, and he had a following of fervent
and resolute men in the country so numerous that
his support was essential and his opinions had to
be treated with respect.</p>

<p>The career of Charles Francis Adams in England
will be read for the first time in the life which
forms a part of this series. It has been written
by his son, of course with every possible advantage,
and it is one of the most interesting chapters
in the history of the civil war. Of him, too, it
may be said that he seems to have been specially
raised up for precisely the duty which he had to
<!-- Image No 16 --><a name='Png016'></a><a name='Page_xiv'></a><span class="pagenum">xiv</span>
fulfill. A blunder on the part of our envoy to
Great Britain would have possibly led to consequences
which one trembles to contemplate even in
imagination. The services of Franklin in France
and the positive good of the French alliance in the
Revolution, may be compared with the services of
Mr. Adams in England and the negative advantage
of non-interference by England on behalf of the
South in the civil war. Mr. Adams's coolness, his
unerring judgment, and the prestige of his name,
in combination, made him the one man in the
United States who ought by fitness to have held
his post. That he did hold it was, perhaps, one of
the two or three essential facts which together
made Northern success possible, by the elimination
of unfair and extrinsic causes of defeat.</p>

<p>One part only of the picture remains to be
drawn, the House of Representatives. It is by
no means conducive to a cheerful patriotic pride to
contemplate the general throng of the politicians
of the country during the war. In plain truth,
they did themselves little credit. Amid the excitement
of the times they utterly failed to appreciate
their true position, their personal and
official limitations. They could not let military
matters alone; they did not often recognize the
boundaries of their own knowledge, and the proper
scope of their usefulness. They intermeddled
<!-- Image No 17 --><a name='Png017'></a><a name='Page_xv'></a><span class="pagenum">xv</span>
ceaselessly, embroiled everything, and as a consequence
they obstructed success in the field almost
as much as if they had been another Confederate
army. It has been with some difficulty that
any one from among them has been found whose
life it was desirable to write. But Thaddeus
Stevens was really a man of great power and note.
Intense and earnest, he exerted a magnificent influence
in the way of encouragement and inspiration.
He adhered, if not altogether so closely as
he ought, yet at least more closely than did many
others, to the proper sphere of his duties as a
civilian. Influential in oratory, skillful in political
management, masterful in temperament, and of
unflinching loyalty, he was long the genuine leader
of the House. In recalling the several members
of that body he stands forth as the one striking
and dominant figure. Nor did his activity cease
with the war; he continued pre&euml;minent in the
questions which immediately succeeded it, so that
the reconstruction of the country, without which
our story would be incomplete, finds its proper
place in his biography. Therewith, I think, the
series reaches completion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h2>THE RAW MATERIAL</h2>

<p>Abraham Lincoln knew little concerning his
progenitors, and rested well content with the scantiness
of his knowledge. The character and condition
of his father, of whom alone upon that side
of the house he had personal cognizance, did not
encourage him to pry into the obscurity behind that
luckless rover. He was sensitive on the subject;
and when he was applied to for information, a
brief paragraph conveyed all that he knew or desired
to know. Without doubt he would have been
best pleased to have the world take him solely for
himself, with no inquiry as to whence he came,&mdash;as
if he had dropped upon the planet like a meteorite;
as, indeed, many did piously hold that he
came a direct gift from heaven. The fullest statement
which he ever made was given in December,
1859, to Mr. Fell, who had interrogated him with
an eye &quot;to the possibilities of his being an available
candidate for the presidency in 1860:&quot; &quot;My
<!-- Image No 24 --><a name='Png024'></a><a name='Page002'></a><span class="pagenum">002</span>
parents were both born in Virginia, of undistinguished
families,&mdash;second families, perhaps I
should say. My mother ... was of a family of
the name of Hanks, some of whom now remain in
Adams, some others in Macon, counties, Illinois.
My paternal grandfather, Abraham Lincoln, emigrated
from Rockingham County, Virginia, to Kentucky,
about 1781 or 1782.... His ancestors,
who were Quakers, went to Virginia from Berks
County, Pennsylvania. An effort to identify them
with the New England family of the same name
ended in nothing more definite than a similarity of
Christian names in both families, such as Enoch,
Levi, Mordecai, Solomon, Abraham, and the like.&quot;
This effort to connect the President with the
Lincolns of Massachusetts was afterward carried
forward by others, who felt an interest greater than
his own in establishing the fact. Yet if he had
expected the quest to result satisfactorily, he would
probably have been less indifferent about it; for
it is obvious that, in common with all Americans
of the old native stock, he had a strenuous desire
to come of &quot;respectable people;&quot; and his very
reluctance to have his apparently low extraction
investigated is evidence that he would have been
glad to learn that he belonged to an ancient and
historical family of the old Puritan Commonwealth,
settlers not far from Plymouth Rock, and immigrants
not long after the arrival of the Mayflower.
This descent has at last been traced by the patient
genealogist.</p>

So early as 1848 the first useful step was taken
by Hon. Solomon Lincoln of Hingham, Massachusetts,
who was struck by a speech delivered by
Abraham Lincoln in the national House of Representatives,
and wrote to ask facts as to his parentage.
The response<a name='FNanchor_1_1'></a><a href='#Footnote_1_1'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
 stated substantially what was
afterward sent to Mr. Fell, above quoted. Mr.
Solomon Lincoln, however, pursued the search farther,
and printed the results<a name='FNanchor_2_2'></a><a href='#Footnote_2_2'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
. Later, Mr. Samuel
Shackford of Chicago, Illinois, himself a descendant
from the same original stock, pushed the investigation
more persistently<a name='FNanchor_3_3'></a><a href='#Footnote_3_3'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
. The chain, as put together
by these two gentlemen, is as follows: Hingham,
Massachusetts, was settled in 1635. In 1636 house
lots were set off to Thomas Lincoln, the miller,
Thomas Lincoln, the weaver, and Thomas Lincoln,
the cooper. In 1638 other lots were set off to
Thomas Lincoln, the husbandman, and to Stephen,
his brother. In 1637 Samuel Lincoln, aged eighteen,
came from England to Salem, Massachusetts,
and three years later went to Hingham; he also
was a weaver, and a brother of Thomas, the weaver.
In 1644 there was a Daniel Lincoln in the place.
All these Lincolns are believed to have come from
the County of Norfolk in England<a name='FNanchor_4_4'></a><a href='#Footnote_4_4'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
, though what
<!-- Image No 26 --><a name='Png026'></a><a name='Page004'></a><span class="pagenum">004</span>
kinship existed between them is not known. It is
from Samuel that the President appears to have
been descended. Samuel's fourth son, Mordecai, a
blacksmith, married a daughter of Abraham Jones
of Hull;<a name='FNanchor_5_5'></a><a href='#Footnote_5_5'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
 about 1704 he moved to the neighboring
town of Scituate, and there set up a furnace for
smelting iron ore. This couple had six children,
of whom two were named respectively Mordecai
and Abraham; and these two are believed to have
gone to Monmouth County, New Jersey. There
Mordecai seems to have continued in the iron
business, and later to have made another move to
Chester County, Pennsylvania, still continuing in
the same business, until, in 1725, he sold out all
his &quot;Mynes &amp; Minerals, Forges, etc.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_6_6'></a><a href='#Footnote_6_6'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
 Then,
migrating again, he settled in Amity, Philadelphia
County, Pennsylvania, where, at last, death caught
up with him. By his will, February 22, 1735-36,
he bequeathed his land in New Jersey to John,
his eldest son; and gave other property to his
sons Mordecai and Thomas. He belied the old
motto, for in spite of more than three removes he
left a fair estate, and in the probate proceedings
he is described as &quot;gentleman.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_7_7'></a><a href='#Footnote_7_7'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
 In 1748 John
<!-- Image No 27 --><a name='Png027'></a><a name='Page005'></a><span class="pagenum">005</span>
sold all he had in New Jersey, and in 1758 moved
into Virginia, settling in that part of Augusta
County which was afterward set off as Rockingham
County. Though his will has not been found,
there is &quot;ample proof,&quot; says Mr. Shackford, that
he had five sons, named Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,
Thomas, and John. Of these, Abraham went to
North Carolina, there married Mary Shipley, and
by her had sons Mordecai, Josiah, and Thomas,
who was born in 1778. In 1780 or 1782, as it is
variously stated, this family moved to Kentucky.
There, one day in 1784, the father, at his labor in
the field, was shot by lurking Indians. His oldest
son, working hard by, ran to the house for a gun;
returning toward the spot where lay his father's
body, he saw an Indian in the act of seizing his
brother, the little boy named Thomas. He fired,
with happy aim; the Indian fell dead, and Thomas
escaped to the house. This Thomas it was who
afterward became the father of Abraham Lincoln.<a name='FNanchor_8_8'></a><a href='#Footnote_8_8'><sup>[8]</sup></a>

Of the other sons of Mordecai (great-uncles
of the President), Thomas also went to
Kentucky, Isaac went to Tennessee, while Jacob
and John stayed in Virginia, and begat progeny
who became in later times ferocious rebels, and of
whom one wrote a very comical blustering letter to
his relative the President;<a name='FNanchor_9_9'></a><a href='#Footnote_9_9'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
 and probably another,
<!-- Image No 28 --><a name='Png028'></a><a name='Page006'></a><span class="pagenum">006</span>
bearing oddly enough the name of Abraham, was
a noted fighter.<a name='FNanchor_10_10'></a><a href='#Footnote_10_10'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
 It is curious to observe of what
migratory stock we have here the sketch. Mr.
Shackford calls attention to the fact that through
six successive generations all save one were &quot;pioneers
in the settlement of new countries,&quot; thus:
1. Samuel came from England to Hingham, Massachusetts.
2. Mordecai lived and died at Scituate,
close by the place of his birth. 3. Mordecai moved,
and settled in Pennsylvania, in the neighborhood
which afterward became Berks County, while it
was still wilderness. 4. John moved into the wilds
of Virginia. 5. Abraham went to the backwoods
of Kentucky shortly after Boone's settlement. 6.
Thomas moved first into the sparsely settled parts
of Indiana, and thence went onward to a similar
region in Illinois.</p>

<p>Thus in time was corroborated what Abraham
Lincoln wrote in 1848 in one of the above-mentioned
letters to Hon. Solomon Lincoln: &quot;We
have a vague tradition that my great-grandfather
went from Pennsylvania to Virginia, and that he
was a Quaker.&quot; It is of little consequence that
this &quot;vague tradition&quot; was stoutly contradicted
by the President's father, the ignorant Thomas,
who indignantly denied that either a Puritan or
a Quaker could be found in the line of his forbears,
and who certainly seemed to set heredity at
defiance if such were the case. But while thus
repudiating others, Thomas himself was in some
<!-- Image No 29 --><a name='Png029'></a><a name='Page007'></a><span class="pagenum">007</span>
danger of being repudiated; for so pained have
some persons been by the necessity of recognizing
Thomas Lincoln as the father of the President,
that they have welcomed, as a happy escape from
this so miserable paternity, a bit of gratuitous and
unsupported gossip, published, though perhaps with
more of malice than of faith, by Mr. Herndon, to
the effect that Abraham Lincoln was the illegitimate
son of some person unknown, presumably
some tolerably well-to-do Kentuckian, who induced
Thomas to assume the r&ocirc;le of parent.</p>

<p>Upon the mother's side the ancestral showing is
meagre, and fortunately so, since the case seems
to be a bad one beyond reasonable hope. Her
name was Nancy Hanks. She was born in Virginia,
and was the illegitimate child of one Lucy
Hanks.<a name='FNanchor_11_11'></a><a href='#Footnote_11_11'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
 Nor was she the only instance of illegitimacy<a name='FNanchor_12_12'></a><a href='#Footnote_12_12'><sup>[12]</sup></a>

in a family which, by all accounts, seems
to have been very low in the social scale. Mr.
Herndon calls them by the dread name of &quot;poor
whites,&quot; and gives an unappetizing sketch of
them.<a name='FNanchor_13_13'></a><a href='#Footnote_13_13'><sup>[13]</sup></a>
 Throughout his pages and those of Lamon
there is abundant and disagreeable evidence
to show the correctness of his estimate. Nancy
Hanks herself, who certainly was not to blame for
her parentage, and perhaps may have improved
matters by an infusion of better blood from her
<!-- Image No 30 --><a name='Png030'></a><a name='Page008'></a><span class="pagenum">008</span>
unknown father, is described by some as a very
rare flower to have bloomed amid the bed of
ugly weeds which surrounded her. These friendly
writers make her a gentle, lovely, Christian creature,
too delicate long to survive the roughness
of frontier life and the fellowship of the shiftless
rover to whom she was unfittingly wedded.<a name='FNanchor_14_14'></a><a href='#Footnote_14_14'><sup>[14]</sup></a>

Whatever she may have been, her picture is exceeding
dim, and has been made upon scant and
not unquestionable evidence. Mr. Lincoln seems
not often to have referred to her; but when he
did so it was with expressions of affection for her
character and respect for her mental qualities, provided
at least that it was really of her, and not of
his stepmother, that he was speaking,&mdash;a matter
not clear from doubt.<a name='FNanchor_15_15'></a><a href='#Footnote_15_15'><sup>[15]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>On June 10, 1806, Thomas Lincoln gave bond
in the &quot;just and full sum of fifty pounds&quot; to
marry Nancy Hanks, and two days later, June
12, he did so, in Washington County, Kentucky.<a name='FNanchor_16_16'></a><a href='#Footnote_16_16'><sup>[16]</sup></a>

She was then twenty-three years old. February
12, 1807, their daughter Sarah was born, who was
married and died leaving no issue. February 12,
1809, Abraham Lincoln was born; no other children
came save a boy who lived only a few days.</p>

<p>The domestic surroundings amid which the babe
came into life were wretched in the extreme. All
<!-- Image No 31 --><a name='Png031'></a><a name='Page009'></a><span class="pagenum">009</span>
the trustworthy evidence depicts a condition of
what civilized people call misery. It is just as
well to acknowledge a fact which cannot now be
obscured by any amount of euphemism. Yet very
many of Lincoln's biographers have been greatly
concerned to color this truth, which he himself,
with his honest nature, was never willing to misrepresent,
however much he resisted efforts to give
it a general publicity. He met curious inquiry
with reticence, but with no attempt to mislead.
Some of his biographers, however, while shunning
direct false statements, have used alleviating adjectives
with literary skill, and have drawn fanciful
pictures of a pious frugal household, of a gallant
frontiersman endowed with a long catalogue
of noble qualities, and of a mother like a Madonna
in the wilderness.<a name='FNanchor_17_17'></a><a href='#Footnote_17_17'><sup>[17]</sup></a>
 Yet all the evidence that there
is goes to show that this romantic coloring is purely
illusive. Rough, coarse, low, ignorant, and poverty-stricken
surroundings were about the child;
and though we may gladly avail ourselves of the
possibility of believing his mother to have been
superior to all the rest of it, yet she could by no
means leaven the mass. The father<a name='FNanchor_18_18'></a><a href='#Footnote_18_18'><sup>[18]</sup></a>
 was by calling
a carpenter, but not good at his trade, a shiftless
<!-- Image No 32 --><a name='Png032'></a><a name='Page010'></a><span class="pagenum">010</span>
migratory squatter by invincible tendency,
and a very ignorant man, for a long while able
only to form the letters which made his signature,
though later he extended his accomplishments a
little. He rested not much above the very bottom
of existence in the pioneer settlements, apparently
without capacity or desire to do better. The
family was imbued with the peculiar, intense, but
unenlightened form of Christianity, mingled with
curious superstition, prevalent in the backwoods,
and begotten by the influence of the vast wilderness
upon illiterate men of a rude native force. It
interests scholars to trace the evolutions of religious
faiths, but it might be not less suggestive
to study the retrogression of religion into superstition.
Thomas was as restless in matters of creed
as of residence, and made various changes in both
during his life. These were, however, changes
without improvement, and, so far as he was concerned,
his son Abraham might have grown up to
be what he himself was contented to remain.</p>

<p>It was in the second year after his marriage
that Thomas Lincoln made his first removal. Four
years later he made another. Two or three years
afterwards, in the autumn of 1816, he abandoned
Kentucky and went into Indiana. Some writers
have given to this migration the interesting
character of a flight from a slave-cursed society
to a land of freedom, but whatever poetic fitness
there might be in such a motive, the suggestion is
entirely gratuitous and without the slightest foundation.<a name='FNanchor_19_19'></a><a href='#Footnote_19_19'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
<!-- Image No 33 --><a name='Png033'></a><a name='Page011'></a><span class="pagenum">011</span>
In making this move, Thomas's outfit
consisted of a trifling parcel of tools and cooking
utensils, with ever so little bedding, and four hundred
gallons of whiskey. At his new quarters he
built a &quot;half-faced camp&quot; fourteen feet square,
that is to say, a covered shed of three sides, the
fourth side being left open to the weather. In
this, less snug than the winter's cave of a bear,
the family dwelt for a year, and then were translated
to the luxury of a &quot;cabin,&quot; four-walled indeed,
but which for a long while had neither floor,
door, nor window. Amid this hardship and wretchedness
Nancy Lincoln passed away, October 5,
1818, of that dread and mysterious disease, the
scourge of those pioneer communities, known as
the &quot;milk-sickness.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_20_20'></a><a href='#Footnote_20_20'><sup>[20]</sup></a>
 In a rough coffin, fashioned
by her husband &quot;out of green lumber cut
with a whip-saw,&quot; she was laid away in the forest
clearing, and a few months afterward an itinerant
preacher performed some funeral rites over the
poor woman's humble grave.</p>

<p>For a year Thomas Lincoln was a widower.
Then he went back to Kentucky, and found there
Mrs. Sally Johnston, a widow, whom, when she
was the maiden Sarah Bush, he had loved and
courted, and by whom he had been refused. He
now asked again, and with better success. The
marriage was a little inroad of good luck into his
career; for the new wife was thrifty and industrious,
<!-- Image No 34 --><a name='Png034'></a><a name='Page012'></a><span class="pagenum">012</span>
with the ambition and the capacity to improve
the squalid condition of her husband's household.
She had, too, worldly possessions of bedding and
furniture, enough to fill a four-horse wagon. She
made her husband put a floor, a door, and windows
to his cabin. From the day of her advent a new
spirit made itself felt amid the belongings of the
inefficient Thomas. Her immediate effort was to
make her new husband's children &quot;look a little
more human,&quot; and the youthful Abraham began
to get crude notions of the simpler comforts and
decencies of life. All agree that she was a stepmother
to whose credit it is to be said that she
manifested an intelligent kindness towards Abraham.</p>

<p>The opportunities for education were scant
enough in that day and place. In his childhood
in Kentucky Abraham got a few weeks with one
teacher, and then a few weeks with another.
Later, in Indiana, he studied a few months, in a
scattered way. Probably he had instruction at
home, for the sum of all the schooling which he
had in his whole life was hardly one year;<a name='FNanchor_21_21'></a><a href='#Footnote_21_21'><sup>[21]</sup></a>
 a singular
start upon the road to the presidency of the
United States! The books which he saw were
few, but a little later he laid hands upon them all
and read and re-read them till he must have absorbed
all their strong juice into his own nature.
Nicolay and Hay give the list: The Bible;
&quot;Aesop's Fables;&quot; &quot;Robinson Crusoe;&quot; &quot;The
<!-- Image No 35 --><a name='Png035'></a><a name='Page013'></a><span class="pagenum">013</span>
Pilgrim's Progress;&quot; a history of the United
States; Weems's &quot;Washington.&quot; He was doubtless
much older when he devoured the Revised
Statutes of Indiana in the office of the town constable.
Dr. Holland adds Lives of Henry Clay
and of Franklin (probably the famous autobiography),
and Ramsay's &quot;Washington;&quot; and Arnold
names Shakespeare and Burns. It was a small
library, but nourishing. He used to write and to
do sums in arithmetic on the wooden shovel by the
fireside, and to shave off the surface in order to
renew the labor.</p>

<p>As he passed from boyhood to youth his mental
development took its characteristics from the popular
demand of the neighborhood. He scribbled
verses and satirical prose, wherein the coarse wit
was adapted to the taste of the comrades whom it
was designed to please; and it must be admitted
that, after giving due weight to all ameliorating
considerations, it is impossible to avoid disappointment
at the grossness of the jesting. No thought,
no word raised it above the low level of the audience
made up of the laborers on the farms and
the loungers in the groceries. The biographer
who has made public &quot;The First Chronicles of
Reuben&quot; deserves to be held in detestation.<a name='FNanchor_22_22'></a><a href='#Footnote_22_22'><sup>[22]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>A more satisfactory form of intellectual effervescence
consisted in writing articles on the American
<!-- Image No 36 --><a name='Png036'></a><a name='Page014'></a><span class="pagenum">014</span>
Government, Temperance, etc., and in speech-making
to any who were near at the moment of
inspiration. There is abundant evidence, also,
that already Lincoln was regarded as a witty fellow,
a rare mimic, and teller of jokes and stories;
and therefore was the champion of the fields and
the favorite of all the primitive social gatherings.
This sort of life and popularity had its perils, for
in that day and region men seldom met without
drinking together; but all authorities are agreed
that Lincoln, while the greatest talker, was the
smallest drinker.</p>

<p>The stories told of his physical strength rival
those which decorate the memory of Hercules.
Others, which show his kindly and humane nature,
are more valuable. Any or all of these may
or may not be true, and, though they are not so
poetical or marvelous as the myths which lend an
antique charm to the heroes of classic and romantic
lore, yet they compare fairly well with those
which Weems has twined about the figure of the
youthful Washington. There is a tale of the rescue
of a pig from a quagmire, and another of the
saving of a drunken man from freezing. There
are many stories of fights; others of the lifting of
enormous weights; and even some of the doing
of great feats of labor in a day, though for such
tasks Lincoln had no love. These are not worth
recounting; there is store of such in every village
about the popular local hero; and though historians
by such folk-lore may throw a glamour about
<!-- Image No 37 --><a name='Png037'></a><a name='Page015'></a><span class="pagenum">015</span>
Lincoln's daily life, he himself, at the time, could
hardly have seen much that was romantic or poetical
in the routine of ill-paid labor and hard living.
Until he came of age his &quot;time&quot; belonged to his
father, who let him out to the neighbors for any
job that offered, making him a man-of-all-work,
without-doors and within. In 1825 he was thus
earning six dollars a month, presumably besides
board and lodging. Sometimes he slaughtered
hogs, at thirty-one cents a day; and in this &quot;rough
work&quot; he was esteemed especially efficient. Such
was the making of a President in the United States
in this nineteenth century!</p>

<p>Thomas Lincoln, like most men of his stamp,
had the cheerful habit of laying the results of his
own worthlessness to the charge of the conditions
about him, which, naturally, he constantly sought
to change, since it seemed that no change could
bring him to a lower level than he had already
found. As Abraham approached his &quot;freedom-day,&quot;
his luckless parent conceived the notion that
he might do better in Illinois than he had done in
Indiana. So he shuffled off the farm, for which he
had never paid, and about the middle of February
the family caravan, with their scanty household
wares packed in an ox team, began a march which
lasted fourteen days and entailed no small measure
of hardship. They finally stopped at a bluff on
the north bank of the north fork of the Sangamon,
a stream which empties into the Ohio. Here
Thomas Lincoln renewed the familiar process of
<!-- Image No 38 --><a name='Png038'></a><a name='Page016'></a><span class="pagenum">016</span>
&quot;starting in life,&quot; and with an axe, a saw, and
a knife built a rough cabin of hewed logs, with a
smoke-house and &quot;stable.&quot; Abraham, aided by
John Hanks, cleared ten or fifteen acres of land,
split the rails and fenced it, planted it with corn,
and made it over to Thomas as a sort of bequest at
the close of his term of legal infancy. His subsequent
relationship with his parents, especially with
his father, seems to have been slight, involving an
occasional gift of money, a very rare visit, and
finally a commonplace letter of Christian comfort
when the old man was on his deathbed.<a name='FNanchor_23_23'></a><a href='#Footnote_23_23'><sup>[23]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>At first Abraham's coming of age made no especial
change in his condition; he continued to find
such jobs as he could, as an example of which Is
mentioned his bargain with Mrs. Nancy Miller &quot;to
split four hundred rails for every yard of brown
jeans dyed with white walnut bark that would be
necessary to make him a pair of trousers.&quot; After
many months there arrived in the neighborhood
one Denton Offut, one of those scheming, talkative,
evanescent busybodies who skim vaguely over
new territories. This adventurer had a cargo of
hogs, pork, and corn, which he wanted to send to
New Orleans, and the engagement fell to Lincoln
and two comrades at the wage of fifty cents per
day and a bonus of $60 for the three. It has
been said that this and a preceding trip down the
Mississippi first gave Lincoln a glimpse of slavery
in concrete form, and that the spectacle of
<!-- Image No 39 --><a name='Png039'></a><a name='Page017'></a><span class="pagenum">017</span>
negroes &quot;in chains, whipped and scourged,&quot; and
of a slave auction, implanted in his mind an &quot;unconquerable
hate&quot; towards the institution, so that
he exclaimed: &quot;If ever I get a chance to hit that
thing, I'll hit it hard.&quot; So the loquacious myth-maker
John Hanks asserts;<a name='FNanchor_24_24'></a><a href='#Footnote_24_24'><sup>[24]</sup></a>
 but Lincoln himself
refers his first vivid impression to a later trip,
made in 1841, when there were &quot;on board ten or
a dozen slaves shackled together with irons.&quot; Of
this subsequent incident he wrote, fourteen years
later, to his friend, Joshua Speed: &quot;That sight
was a continual torment to me; and I see something
like it every time I touch the Ohio or any
other slave border. It is not fair for you to assume
that I have no interest in a thing which has,
and continually exercises, the power of making me
miserable.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_25_25'></a><a href='#Footnote_25_25'><sup>[25]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>Of more immediate consequence was the notion
which the rattle-brained Offut conceived of Lincoln's
general ability. This lively patron now
proposed to build a river steamboat, with &quot;runners
for ice and rollers for shoals and dams,&quot; of
which his redoubtable young employee was to be
captain. But this strange scheme gave way to
another for opening in New Salem a &quot;general
store&quot; of all goods. This small town had been
born only a few months before this summer of
1831, and was destined to a brief but riotous life
of some seven years' duration. Now it had a
<!-- Image No 40 --><a name='Png040'></a><a name='Page018'></a><span class="pagenum">018</span>
dozen or fifteen &quot;houses,&quot; of which some had cost
only ten dollars for the building; yet to the sanguine
Offut it presented a fair field for retail
commerce. He accordingly equipped his &quot;store,&quot;
and being himself engaged in other enterprises, he
installed Lincoln as manager. Soon he also gave
Lincoln a mill to run.</p>

<p>Besides all this patronage, Offut went about
the region bragging in his extravagant way that
his clerk &quot;knew more than any man in the United
States,&quot; would some day be President, and could
now throw or thrash any man in those parts. Now
it so happened that some three miles out from New
Salem lay Clary's Grove, the haunt of a gang of
frontier ruffians of the familiar type, among whom
one Jack Armstrong was champion bully. Offut's
boasting soon rendered an encounter between Lincoln
and Armstrong inevitable, though Lincoln
did his best to avoid it, and declared his aversion
to &quot;this woolling and pulling.&quot; The wrestling
match was arranged, and the settlers flocked to it
like Spaniards to a bull-fight. Battle was joined
and Lincoln was getting the better of Armstrong,
whereupon the &quot;Clary's Grove boys,&quot; with fine
chivalry, were about to rush in upon Lincoln and
maim him, or worse, when the timely intervention
of a prominent citizen possibly saved even the
life of the future President.<a name='FNanchor_26_26'></a><a href='#Footnote_26_26'><sup>[26]</sup></a>
 Some of the biographers,
borrowing the license of poets, have chosen
to tell about the &quot;boys&quot; and the wrestling match
<!-- Image No 41 --><a name='Png041'></a><a name='Page019'></a><span class="pagenum">019</span>
with such picturesque epithets that the combat
bids fair to appear to posterity as romantic as
that of Friar Tuck and Robin Hood. Its consequence
was that Armstrong and Lincoln were fast
friends ever after. Wherever Lincoln was at
work, Armstrong used to &quot;do his loafing,&quot; and
Lincoln made visits to Clary's Grove, and long
afterward did a friendly service to &quot;old Hannah,&quot;
Armstrong's wife, by saving one of her vicious
race from the gallows, which upon that especial
occasion he did not happen to deserve. Also
Armstrong and his gang gave Lincoln hearty political
support, and an assistance at the polls which
was very effective, for success generally smiled on
that candidate who had as his constituency<a name='FNanchor_27_27'></a><a href='#Footnote_27_27'><sup>[27]</sup></a>
 the
&quot;butcher-knife boys,&quot; the &quot;barefooted boys,&quot; the
&quot;half-horse, half-alligator men,&quot; and the &quot;huge-pawed
boys.&quot;</p>

<p>An item less susceptible of a poetic coloring is
that about this time Lincoln ransacked the neighborhood
in search of an English grammar, and
getting trace of one six miles out from the settlement,
he walked over to borrow or to buy it. He
brought it back in triumph, and studied it exhaustively.</p>

<p>There are also some tales of his honesty which
may stand without disgrace beside that of Washington
and the cherry-tree, and may be better entitled
to credit. It is said that, while he was
&quot;keeping shop&quot; for Offut, a woman one day accidentally
<!-- Image No 42 --><a name='Png042'></a><a name='Page020'></a><span class="pagenum">020</span>
overpaid him by the sum of fourpence,
and that he walked several miles that night to
restore the sum to her before he slept. On another
occasion, discovering that in selling half a
pound of tea he had used too small a weight, he
started instantly forth to make good the deficiency.
Perhaps this integrity does not so much differentiate
Lincoln from his fellows as it may seem to
do, for it is said that honesty was the one distinguishing
virtue of that queer society. None
the less these legends are exponents, which the
numerous fighting stories are not, of the genuine
nature of the man. His chief trait all his life
long was honesty of all kinds and in all things;
not only commonplace, material honesty in dealings,
but honesty in language, in purpose, in
thought; <i>honesty of mind</i>, so that he could never
even practice the most tempting of all deceits,
a deceit against himself. This pervasive honesty
was the trait of his identity, which stayed with
him from beginning to end, when other traits
seemed to be changing, appearing or disappearing,
and bewildering the observer of his career. All
the while the universal honesty was there.</p>

<p>It took less than a year for Offut's shop to come
to ruin, for the proprietor to wander off into the
unknown void from which he had come, and for
Lincoln to find himself again without occupation.
He won some local reputation by navigating the
steamboat Talisman up the Sangamon River to
Springfield; but nothing came of it.</p>

<!-- Image No 43 --><a name='Png043'></a>
<p><a name='Page021'></a><span class="pagenum">021</span>
The foregoing narrative ought to have given
some idea of the moral and physical surroundings
of Lincoln's early days. Americans need to carry
their memories hardly fifty years back, in order
to have a lively conception of that peculiar body
of men which for many years was pushed out
in front of civilization in the West. Waifs and
strays from highly civilized communities, these
wanderers had not civilization to learn, but rather
they had shuffled off much that belonged to civilization,
and afterwards they had to acquire it
afresh. Among them crudity in thought and uncouthness
in habits were intertwined in odd, incongruous
crossings with the remnants of the more
respectable customs with which they had once been
familiar. Much they forgot and much they put
away as being no longer useful; many of them&mdash;not
all&mdash;became very ignorant without being
stupid, very brutal without being barbarous.
Finding life hard, they helped each other with a
general kindliness which is impracticable among
the complexities of elaborate social organizations.
Those who were born on the land, among whom
Lincoln belonged, were peculiar in having no reminiscences,
no antecedent ideas derived from their
own past, whereby to modify the influences of the
immediate present. What they should think about
men and things they gathered from what they saw
and heard around them. Even the modification to
be got from reading was of the slightest, for very
little reading was possible, even if desired. An
<!-- Image No 44 --><a name='Png044'></a><a name='Page022'></a><span class="pagenum">022</span>
important trait of these Western communities was
the closeness of personal intercourse in them, and
the utter lack of any kind of barriers establishing
strata of society. Individuals might differ ever so
widely; but the wisest and the dullest, the most
worthless and the most enterprising, had to rub
shoulder to shoulder in daily life. Yet the variety
was considerable: hardy and danger-loving
pioneers fulfilling the requirements of romance;
shiftless vagrants curiously combining utter inefficiency
with a sort of bastard contempt for hardship;
ruffians who could only offset against every
brutal vice an ignoble physical courage; intelligent
men whose observant eyes ranged over the whole
region in a shrewd search after enterprise and
profit; a few educated men, decent in apparel
and bearing, useful in legislation and in preventing
the ideal from becoming altogether vulgarized
and debased; and others whose energy was chiefly
of the tongue, the class imbued with a taste for
small politics and the public business. All these
and many other varieties were like ingredients
cast together into a caldron; they could not keep
apart, each with his own kind, to the degree which
is customary in old established communities; but
they all ceaselessly crossed and mingled and met,
and talked, and dealt, and helped and hustled each
other, and exerted upon each other that subtle
inevitable influence resulting from such constant
intercourse; and so they inoculated each other with
certain characteristics which became common to
<!-- Image No 45 --><a name='Png045'></a><a name='Page023'></a><span class="pagenum">023</span>
all and formed the type of the early settler. Thus
was made &quot;the new West,&quot; &quot;the great West,&quot;
which was pushed ever onward, and endured along
each successive frontier for about a generation.
An eternal movement, a tireless coming and going,
pervaded these men; they passed hither and
thither without pause, phantasmagorically; they
seemed to be forever &quot;moving on,&quot; some because
they were real pioneers and natural rovers, others
because they were mere vagrants generally drifting
away from creditors, others because the better
chance seemed ever in the newer place, and all
because they had struck no roots, gathered no
associations, no home ties, no local belongings.
The shopkeeper &quot;moved on&quot; when his notes became
too pressing; the schoolmaster, after a short
stay, left his school to some successor whose accomplishments
could hardly be less than his own;
clergymen ranged vaguely through the country,
to preach, to pray, to bury, to marry, as the case
might be; farmers heard of a more fruitful soil,
and went to seek it. Men certainly had at times
to work hard in order to live at all, yet it was perfectly
possible for the natural idler to rove, to loaf,
and to be shiftless at intervals, and to become as
demoralized as the tramp for whom a shirt and
trousers are the sum of worldly possessions. Books
were scarce; many teachers hardly had as much
book-learning as lads of thirteen years now have
among ourselves. Men who could neither read nor
write abounded, and a deficiency so common could
<!-- Image No 46 --><a name='Png046'></a><a name='Page024'></a><span class="pagenum">024</span>
hardly imply much disgrace or a marked inferiority;
many learned these difficult arts only in mature
years. Fighting was a common pastime, and
when these rough fellows fought, they fought like
savages; Lincoln's father bit off his adversary's
nose in a fight, and a cousin lost the same feature
in the same way; the &quot;gouging&quot; of eyes was a
legitimate resource. The necessity of fighting
might at any moment come to any one; even the
combination of a peaceable disposition with formidable
strength did not save Lincoln from numerous
personal affrays, of which many are remembered,
and not improbably many more have been forgotten.
In spite of the picturesque adjectives which
have been so decoratively used in describing the
ruffian of the frontier, he seems to have been about
what his class always is; and when these fellows
had forced a fight, or &quot;set up&quot; a match, their
chivalry never prevented any unfairness or brutality.
A tale illustrative of the times is told of a
closely contested election in the legislature for the
office of state treasurer. The worsted candidate
strode into the hall of the Assembly, and gallantly
selecting four of the largest and strongest of those
who had voted against him, thrashed them soundly.
The other legislators ran away. But before the
close of the session this pugilist, who so well understood
practical politics, was appointed clerk of the
Circuit Court and county recorder.<a name='FNanchor_28_28'></a><a href='#Footnote_28_28'><sup>[28]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>Corn bread was the chief article of diet; potatoes
<!-- Image No 47 --><a name='Png047'></a><a name='Page025'></a><span class="pagenum">025</span>
were a luxury, and were often eaten raw like apples.
To the people at large whiskey &quot;straight&quot;
seemed the natural drink of man, and whiskey
toddy was not distasteful to woman. To refuse
to drink was to subject one's self to abuse and
suspicion;<a name='FNanchor_29_29'></a><a href='#Footnote_29_29'><sup>[29]</sup></a>
 Lincoln's notorious lack of liking for
it passed for an eccentricity, or a physical peculiarity.
The customary social gatherings were at
horse-racings, at corn-shuckings, at political
speech-makings, at weddings, whereat the coarse
proceedings would not nowadays bear recital; at
log-rollings, where the neighbors gathered to collect
the logs of a newly cleared lot for burning;
and at house-raisings, where they kindly aided to
set up the frame of a cabin for a new-comer; at
camp-meetings, where the hysterical excitement of
a community whose religion was more than half
superstition found clamorous and painful vent;<a name='FNanchor_30_30'></a><a href='#Footnote_30_30'><sup>[30]</sup></a>

or perchance at a hanging, which, if it met public
approbation, would be sanctioned by the gathering
of the neighbors within a day's journey of the
scene. At dancing-parties men and women danced
barefoot; indeed, they could hardly do better,
since their foot-wear was apt to be either moccasins,
or such boots as they themselves could make
from the hides which they themselves had cured.
In Lincoln's boyhood the hunting-shirt and leggings
made of skins were a sufficiently respectable
<!-- Image No 48 --><a name='Png048'></a><a name='Page026'></a><span class="pagenum">026</span>
garb; and buckskin breeches dyed green were
enough to captivate the heart of any girl who
wished a fashionable lover; but by the time that
he had become a young man, most self-respecting
men had suits of jeans. The ugly butcher's knife
and tomahawk, which had been essential as was
the rapier to the costume of gentlemen two centuries
earlier, began now to be more rarely seen at
the belt about the waist. The women wore linsey-woolsey
gowns, of home manufacture, and dyed
according to the taste or skill of the wearer in
stripes and bars with the brown juice of the butternut.
In the towns it was not long before calico
was seen, and calfskin shoes; and in such populous
centres bonnets decorated the heads of the
fair sex. Amid these advances in the art of dress
Lincoln was a laggard, being usually one of the
worst attired men of the neighborhood; not from
affectation, but from a natural indifference to such
matters. The sketch is likely to become classical
in American history of the appearance which he
presented with his scant pair of trousers, &quot;hitched&quot;
by a single suspender over his shirt, and so short
as to expose, at the lower end, half a dozen inches
of &quot;shinbone, sharp, blue, and narrow.&quot;</p>

<p>In the clearings the dwellings of these men were
the &quot;half-faced camp&quot; open upon one side to the
weather, or the doorless, floorless, and windowless
cabin which, with prosperity, might be made luxurious
by greased paper in the windows, and &quot;puncheon&quot;
floors. The furniture was in keeping with this
<!-- Image No 49 --><a name='Png049'></a><a name='Page027'></a><span class="pagenum">027</span>
exterior. At a corner the bed was constructed by
driving into the ground crotched sticks, whence
poles extended to the crevices of the walls; upon
these poles were laid boards, and upon these boards
were tossed leaves and skins and such other alleviating
material as could be found. Three-legged
stools and a table were hewed from the felled trees
with an axe, which was often the settler's only and
invaluable tool, and which he would travel long
miles to sharpen. If a woman wanted a looking-glass,
she scoured a tin pan, but the temptation to
inspect one's self must have been feeble. A very
few kitchen utensils completed the outfit. Troughs
served for washtubs, when wash tubs were used;
and wooden ploughs broke up the virgin soil. The
whole was little, if at all, more comfortable than
the red man's wigwam. In &quot;towns,&quot; so called,
there was of course somewhat more of civilization
than in the clearings. But one must not be misled
by a name; a &quot;town&quot; might signify only a score
of houses, and the length of its life was wholly
problematical; a few days sufficed to build the
wooden huts, which in a few years might be abandoned.
In the early days there was almost no
money among the people; sometimes barter was
resorted to; one lover paid for his marriage license
with maple sugar, another with wolf-scalps. More
often a promise sufficed; credit was a system well
understood, and promissory notes constituted an
unquestioned and popular method of payment that
would have made a millennium for Mr. Micawber.
<!-- Image No 50 --><a name='Png050'></a><a name='Page028'></a><span class="pagenum">028</span>
But however scant might be cash and houses, each
town had its grocery, and these famous &quot;stores&quot;
were by far the chief influence in shaping the
ideas of the Westerner. There all congregated,
the idlers all day long, the busy men in the evening;
and there, stimulated by the whiskey of the
proprietor, they gossiped about everybody's affairs,
talked about business and the prospects of the
neighborhood, and argued about the politics of the
county, the State, and even of the nation. Jokes
and stories, often most uncouth and gross, whiled
away the time. It was in these groceries, and in
the rough crucible of such talk, wherein grotesque
imagery and extravagant phrases were used to
ridicule pretension and to bring every man to his
place, sometimes also to escape taking a hard
fact too hardly, that what we now call &quot;American
humor,&quot; with its peculiar native flavor, was born.
To this it is matter of tradition that Lincoln contributed
liberally. He liked neighborly chat and
discussion; and his fondness for political debate,
and his gifts in tale and jest, made him the most
popular man in every &quot;store&quot; that he entered. It
is commonly believed that the effect of this familiarity
with coarse talk did not afterward disappear,
so that he never became fastidious in language or
in story. But apologists of this habit are doubtless
correct in saying that vulgarity in itself had
no attraction for him; it simply did not repel him,
when with it there was a flavor of humor or a useful
point. Apparently it simply meant nothing to
<!-- Image No 51 --><a name='Png051'></a><a name='Page029'></a><span class="pagenum">029</span>
him; a mental attitude which is not difficult of
comprehension in view of its origin.<a name='FNanchor_31_31'></a><a href='#Footnote_31_31'><sup>[31]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>Some of the most picturesque and amusing pages
of Ford's &quot;History of Illinois&quot; describe the condition
of the bench and bar of these times.<a name='FNanchor_32_32'></a><a href='#Footnote_32_32'><sup>[32]</sup></a>
 &quot;Boys,
come in, our John is going to hold court,&quot; proclaimed
the sheriff; and the &quot;boys&quot; loitered into
the barroom of the tavern, or into a log cabin
where the judge sat on the bed and thus, really
from the woolsack, administered &quot;law&quot; mixed with
equity as best he knew it. Usually these magistrates
were prudent in guiding the course of practical
justice, and rarely summed up the facts lest
they should make dangerous enemies, especially in
criminal cases; they often refused to state the law,
and generally for a very good reason. They liked
best to turn the whole matter over to the jurors,
who doubtless &quot;understood the case, and would do
justice between the parties.&quot; The books of the
science were scarce, and lawyers who studied them
were perhaps scarcer. But probably substantial
fairness in decision did not suffer by reason of
lack of sheepskin learning.</p>

<p>Politics for a long while were strictly personal;
the elections did not turn upon principles or measures,
but upon the popular estimate of the candidates
individually. Political discussion meant unstinted
<!-- Image No 52 --><a name='Png052'></a><a name='Page030'></a><span class="pagenum">030</span>
praise and unbounded vilification. A man
might, if he chose, resent a vote against himself
as a personal insult, and hence arose much secrecy
and the &quot;keep dark&quot; system. Stump-speaking,
whiskey, and fighting were the chief elements of a
campaign, and the worst class in society furnished
the most efficient backing.<a name='FNanchor_33_33'></a><a href='#Footnote_33_33'><sup>[33]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>Such was the condition of men and things in
the neighborhood where Abraham Lincoln was
shaping in the days of his youth. Yet it was a
condition which did not last long; Illinois herself
changed and grew as rapidly as any youngster
within her borders. The rate of advance in
all that goes to make up what we now regard as
a civilized society was astonishing. Between the
time when Lincoln was fifteen and when he was
twenty-five, the alteration was so great as to be
confusing. One hardly became familiar with a
condition before it had vanished. Some towns
began to acquire an aspect of permanence; clothes
and manners became like those prevalent in older
communities; many men were settling down in
established residence, identifying themselves with
the fortunes of their neighborhood. Young persons
were growing up and staying where they had been
&quot;raised,&quot; as the phrase of a farming community
had it. Comfortable and presentable two-story
houses lent an air of prosperity and stimulated
ambition; law-books began to be collected in
<!-- Image No 53 --><a name='Png053'></a><a name='Page031'></a><span class="pagenum">031</span>
small numbers; and debts were occasionally paid
in money, and could often be collected by legal
process. These improvements were largely due
to the swelling tide of immigration which brought
men of a better type to push their enterprises in
a country presumably emerging from its disagreeable
stage. But the chief educational influence
was to be found in the Anglo-American passion
for an argument and a speech. Hand in hand, as
has so long been the custom in our country, law
and politics moved among the people, who had an
inborn, inherited taste for both; these stimulated
and educated the settlers in a way that only Americans
can appreciate. When Lincoln, as is soon
to be seen, turned to them, he turned to what
then and there appeared the highest callings which
could tempt intellect and ambition.</p>

<p>The pre&euml;minently striking feature in Lincoln's
nature&mdash;not a trait of character, but a characteristic
of the man&mdash;which is noteworthy in these
early days, and grew more so to the very latest,
was the extraordinary degree to which he always
appeared to be in close and sympathetic touch
with the people, that is to say, the people in the
mass wherein he was imbedded, the social body
amid which he dwelt, which pressed upon him on
all sides, which for him formed &quot;the public.&quot;
First this group or body was only the population
of the frontier settlement; then it widened to
include the State of Illinois; then it expanded
to the population of the entire North; and such
<!-- Image No 54 --><a name='Png054'></a><a name='Page032'></a><span class="pagenum">032</span>
had come to be the popular appreciation of this
remarkably developed quality that, at the time of
his death, his admirers even dared to believe that
it would be able to make itself one with all the
heterogeneous, discordant, antagonistic elements
which then composed the very disunited United
States. It is by reason of this quality that it
has seemed necessary to depict so far as possible
that peculiar, transitory phase of society which
surrounded his early days. This quality in him
caused him to be exceptionally susceptible to the
peculiar influences of the people among whom his
lot was cast. This quality for a while prevented
his differentiating himself from them, prevented
his accepting standards and purposes unlike theirs
either in speech or action, prevented his rising
rapidly to a higher moral plane than theirs. This
quality kept him essentially one of them, until his
&quot;people&quot; and his &quot;public&quot; expanded beyond them.
It has been the fashion of his admirers to manifest
an extreme distaste for a truthful presentation of
his earlier days. Some writers have passed very
lightly over them; others, stating plain facts with
a formal accuracy, have used their skill to give to
the picture an untruthful miscoloring; two or three,
instinct with the spirit of Zola, have made their
sketch with plain unsparing realism in color as well
as in lines, and so have brought upon themselves
abuse, and perhaps have deserved much of it, by
reason of a lack of skill in doing an unwelcome
thing, or rather by reason of overdoing it. The
<!-- Image No 55 --><a name='Png055'></a><a name='Page033'></a><span class="pagenum">033</span>
feeling which has led to suppression or to a falsely
romantic description seems to me unreasonable and
wrong. The very quality which made Lincoln, as
a young man, not much superior to his coarse surroundings
was precisely the same quality which,
ripening and expanding rapidly and grandly with
maturing years and a greater circle of humanity,
made him what he was in later life. It is through
this quality that we get continuity in him; without
it, we cannot evade the insoluble problem of two
men,&mdash;two lives,&mdash;one following the other with
no visible link of connection between them; without
it we have physically one creature, morally
and mentally two beings. If we reject this trait,
we throw away the only key which unlocks the
problem of the most singular life, taken from end
to end, which has ever been witnessed among men,
a life which many have been content to regard as
an unsolved enigma. But if we admit and really
perceive and feel the full force of this trait, developed
in him in a degree probably unequaled in
the annals of men, then, besides the enlightenment
which it brings, we have the great satisfaction of
eliminating much of the disagreeableness attendant
upon his youthful days. Even the commonness
and painful coarseness of his foolish written
expressions become actually an exponent of his
chief and crowning quality, his receptiveness and
his expression of humanity,&mdash;that is to say, of all
the humanity he then knew. At first he expressed
what he could discern with the limited, inexperienced
<!-- Image No 56 --><a name='Png056'></a><a name='Page034'></a><span class="pagenum">034</span>
vision of the ignorant son of a wretched
vagrant pioneer; later he gave expression to the
humanity of a people engaged in a purpose physically
and morally as vast and as grand as any
enterprise which the world has seen. Thus, with
perfect fairness, without wrenching or misrepresentation
or sophistry, the ugliness of his youth
ceases to be his own and becomes only the presentation
of a curious social condition. In his youth
he expressed a low condition, in later life a noble
one; at each period he expressed correctly what
he found. His day and generation uttered itself
through him. With such thoughts, and from this
point of view, it is possible to contemplate Lincoln's
early days, amid all their degraded surroundings
and influences and unmarked by apparent
antagonism or obvious superiority on his part,
without serious dismay.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h2>THE START IN LIFE</h2>

<p>In Illinois during the years of Lincoln's boyhood
the red man was retiring sullenly before the fatal
advance of the white man's frontier. Shooting,
scalping, and plundering forays still occurred, and
in the self-complaisant reminiscences of the old
settlers of that day the merciless and mysterious
savage is apt to lend to the narrative the lively
coloring of mortal danger.<a name='FNanchor_34_34'></a><a href='#Footnote_34_34'><sup>[34]</sup></a>
 In the spring of 1832
a noted chief of the Sacs led a campaign of such
importance that it lives in history under the dignified
title of &quot;the Black Hawk war.&quot; The Indians
gathered in numbers so formidable that Governor
Reynolds issued a call for volunteers to aid the
national forces. Lincoln, left unemployed by the
failure of Offut, at once enlisted. The custom
then was, so soon as there were enough recruits
for a company, to elect a captain by vote. The
method was simple: each candidate stood at some
point in the field and the men went over to one
or another according to their several preferences.
Three fourths of the company to which Lincoln
belonged ranged themselves with him, and long
<!-- Image No 58 --><a name='Png058'></a><a name='Page036'></a><span class="pagenum">036</span>
afterward he used to say that no other success in
life had given him such pleasure as did this one.</p>

<p>The company was attached to the Fourth Illinois
Regiment, commanded by Colonel Samuel Thompson,
in the brigade of General Samuel Whiteside.
On April 27 they started for the scene of conflict,
and for many days endured much hardship
of hunger and rough marching. But thereby they
escaped serious danger, for they were too fatigued
to go forward on May 12, when the cavalry battalions
rode out gallantly, recklessly, perhaps a
little stupidly, into ambush and death. It so
happened that Lincoln never came nearer to any
engagement than he did to this one of &quot;Stillman's
Run;&quot; so that in place of military glory he had
to be content with the reputation of being the best
comrade and story-teller at the camp fire. He
had, however, an opportunity to do one honorable
act: the brief term of service of the volunteers
expired on May 27, and most of them eagerly hastened
away from an irksome task, without regard to
the fact that their services were still much needed,
whereas Lincoln and some other officers re&euml;nlisted
as privates. They were made the &quot;Independent
Spy Battalion&quot; of mounted volunteers, were given
many special privileges, but were concerned in
no engagement, and erelong were mustered out
of service. Lincoln's certificate of discharge was
signed by Robert Anderson, who afterward was in
command at Fort Sumter at the outbreak of the
rebellion. Thus, late in June, Lincoln was again a
<!-- Image No 59 --><a name='Png059'></a><a name='Page037'></a><span class="pagenum">037</span>
civilian in New Salem, and was passing from war to
politics.</p>

<p>Nomination by caucus had not yet been introduced
into Illinois,<a name='FNanchor_35_35'></a><a href='#Footnote_35_35'><sup>[35]</sup></a>
 and any person who wished to
be a candidate for an elective office simply made
public announcement of the fact and then conducted
his campaign as best he could.<a name='FNanchor_36_36'></a><a href='#Footnote_36_36'><sup>[36]</sup></a>
 On March
9, 1832, shortly before his enlistment, Lincoln issued
a manifesto &quot;To the People of Sangamon County,&quot;
in which he informed them that he should run as a
candidate for the state legislature at the autumn
elections, and told them his political principles.<a name='FNanchor_37_37'></a><a href='#Footnote_37_37'><sup>[37]</sup></a>

He was in favor of internal improvements, such
as opening roads, clearing streams, building a railroad
across Sangamon County, and making the
Sangamon River straight and navigable. He advocated
a usury law, and hazarded the extraordinary
argument that &quot;in cases of extreme necessity there
could always be means found to cheat the law;
while in all other cases it would have its intended
effect.&quot; A law ameliorated by infractions is no
uncommon thing, but this is perhaps the only
instance in which a law has been befriended on the
ground that it can be circumvented. He believed
<!-- Image No 60 --><a name='Png060'></a><a name='Page038'></a><span class="pagenum">038</span>
that every man should &quot;receive at least a moderate
education.&quot; He deprecated changes in existing
laws; for, he said, &quot;considering the great probability
that the framers of those laws were wiser
than myself, I should prefer not meddling with
them.&quot; The clumsy phraseology of his closing
paragraph coupled not badly a frank avowal of
ambition with an ingenuous expression of personal
modesty. The principles thus set forth were those
of Clay and the Whigs, and at this time the &quot;best
people&quot; in Sangamon County belonged to this
party. The Democrats, on the other hand, did not
much concern themselves with principles, but accepted
General Jackson in place thereof, as constituting
in himself a party platform. In the rough-and-tumble
pioneer community they could not do
better, and for many years they had controlled
the State; indeed, Lincoln himself had felt no
small loyalty towards a President who admirably
expressed Western civilization. Now, however, he
considered himself &quot;an avowed Clay man,&quot;<a name='FNanchor_38_38'></a><a href='#Footnote_38_38'><sup>[38]</sup></a>
 and
besides the internal improvement system he spoke
also for a national bank and a high protective
tariff; probably he knew very little about either,
but his partisanship was perfect, for if there was
any distinguishing badge of an anti-Jackson Whig,
it certainly was advocacy of a national bank.</p>

<p>After his return from the &quot;war,&quot; Lincoln set
<!-- Image No 61 --><a name='Png061'></a><a name='Page039'></a><span class="pagenum">039</span>
about electioneering with a good show of energy.
He hardly anticipated success, but at least upon
this trial trip he expected to make himself known
to the people and to gain useful experience. He
&quot;stumped&quot; his own county thoroughly, and is said
to have made speeches which were blunt, crude,
and inartificial, but not displeasing to his audiences.
A story goes that once &quot;a general fight&quot;
broke out among his hearers, and one of his friends
was getting roughly handled, whereupon Lincoln,
descending from the rostrum, took a hand in the
affray, tossed one of the assailants &quot;ten or twelve
feet easily,&quot; and then continued his harangue.
Yet not even thus could he win, and another was
chosen over his head. He had, however, more
reason to be gratified than disappointed with the
result; for, though in plain fact he was a raw and
unknown youngster, he stood third upon a list of
eight candidates, receiving 657 votes; and out of
208 votes cast in his own county he scored 205.<a name='FNanchor_39_39'></a><a href='#Footnote_39_39'><sup>[39]</sup></a>

In this there was ample encouragement for the
future.</p>

<p>The political campaign being over, and legislative
functions postponed, Lincoln was brought face
to face with the pecuniary problem. He contemplated,
not without approbation, the calling of the
blacksmith; but the chance to obtain a part interest
in a grocery &quot;store&quot; tempted him into an occupation
for which he was little fitted. He became
junior partner in the firm of Berry &amp; Lincoln,
<!-- Image No 62 --><a name='Png062'></a><a name='Page040'></a><span class="pagenum">040</span>
which, by executing and delivering sundry notes
of hand, absorbed the whole grocery business of
the town. But Lincoln was hopelessly inefficient
behind the counter, and Berry was a tippler. So
in a year's time the store &quot;winked out,&quot; leaving
as its only important trace those ill-starred scraps
of paper by which it had been founded. Berry
&quot;moved on&quot; from the inconvenient neighborhood,
and soon afterward died, contributing nothing to
reduce the indebtedness. Lincoln patiently continued
to make payments during several years to
come, until he had discharged the whole amount.
It was only a few hundred dollars, but to him it
seemed so enormous that betwixt jest and earnest
he called it &quot;the national debt.&quot; So late as in
1848, when he was a member of the House of
Representatives at Washington, he applied part
of his salary to this old indebtedness.</p>

<p>During this &quot;store&quot;-keeping episode he had
begun to study law, and while &quot;keeping shop&quot; he
was with greater diligence reading Blackstone and
such other elementary classics of the profession
as he could borrow. He studied with zeal and
became absorbed in his books. Perched upon a
woodpile, or lying under a tree with his feet thrust
upwards against the trunk and &quot;grinding around
with the shade,&quot; he caused some neighbors to laugh
uproariously, and others to say that he was daft.
In fact, he was in grim earnest, and held on his
way with much persistence.</p>

<p>May 7, 1833, Lincoln was commissioned as postmaster
<!-- Image No 63 --><a name='Png063'></a><a name='Page041'></a><span class="pagenum">041</span>
at New Salem. His method of distributing
the scanty mail was to put all the letters in
his hat, and to hand them out as he happened to
meet the persons to whom they were addressed.
The emoluments could hardly have gone far towards
the discharge of &quot;the national debt.&quot; His
incumbency in this office led to a story worth telling.
When New Salem, and by necessity also the
post-office, like the grocery shop, &quot;winked out,&quot;
in 1836, there was a trifling balance of sixteen or
eighteen dollars due from Lincoln to the government.
Several years afterward, when he was practicing
law in Springfield, the government agent at
last appeared to demand a settlement. Lincoln
went to his trunk and drew forth &quot;an old blue
sock with a quantity of silver and copper coin tied
up in it,&quot; the identical bits of money which he
had gathered from the people at New Salem, and
which, through many days of need in the long
intervening period, he had not once touched.</p>

<p>Fortunately an occupation now offered itself
which was more lucrative, and possessed also the
valuable quality of leaving niches of leisure for
the study of the law. The mania for speculation
in land had begun in Illinois; great tracts were
being cut up into &quot;town lots,&quot; and there was as
lively a market for real estate as the world has
ever seen. The official surveyor of the county,
John Calhoun, had more work than he could do,
and offered to appoint Lincoln as a deputy. A
little study made him competent for the work,
<!-- Image No 64 --><a name='Png064'></a><a name='Page042'></a><span class="pagenum">042</span>
which he performed for some time with admirable
accuracy, if the stories are to be believed. But
he had not long enjoyed the mild prosperity of
this new career ere an untoward interruption came
from a creditor of the extinct grocery firm. This
man held one of the notes representing &quot;the
national debt,&quot; and now levied execution upon
Lincoln's horse and surveying instruments. Two
friends, however, were at hand in this hour of need,
and Bolin Greene and James Short are gratefully
remembered as the men who generously furnished,
in that actual cash which was so scarce in Illinois,
the sums of one hundred and twenty-five dollars
and one hundred and twenty dollars respectively,
to redeem these essential implements of Lincoln's
business.</p>

<p>The summer of 1834 found Lincoln again a candidate
for the legislature. He ran as a Whig, but
he received and accepted offers of aid from the
Democrats, and their votes swelled the flattering
measure of his success. It has usually been stated
that he led the four successful candidates, the poll
standing: Lincoln, 1,376; Dawson, 1,370; Carpenter,
1,170; Stuart, 1,164. But Mr. Herndon
adduces evidence that Dawson's number was 1,390,
whereby Lincoln is relegated to the second place.
Holland tells us that he &quot;shouldered his pack and
on foot trudged to Vandalia, then the capital of
the State, about a hundred miles, to make his
entrance into public life.&quot; But the correcting pen
of the later biographer interferes with this dramatic
<!-- Image No 65 --><a name='Png065'></a><a name='Page043'></a><span class="pagenum">043</span>
incident also. For it seems that, after the
result of the election was known, Lincoln visited a
friend, Coleman Smoot, and said: &quot;Did you vote
for me?&quot; &quot;I did,&quot; replied Smoot. &quot;Then,&quot; said
Lincoln, &quot;you must lend me two hundred dollars!&quot;
This seemed a peculiar <i>sequitur</i>, for ordinary political
logic would have made any money that was to
pass between voter and candidate move the other
way. Yet Smoot accepted the consequence entailed
in part by his own act, and furnished the
money, whereby Lincoln was able to purchase a
new suit of clothes and to ride in the stage to
Vandalia.</p>

<p>The records of this legislature show nothing noteworthy.
Lincoln was very inappropriately placed
on the Committee on Public Accounts and Expenditures;
also it is recorded that he introduced a
resolution to obtain for the State a part of the
proceeds of the public lands sold within it. What
has chiefly interested the chroniclers is, that at this
session he first saw Stephen A. Douglas, then a
lobbyist, and said of him: &quot;He is the least man
I ever saw.&quot; Lincoln's part seems to have been
rather that of an observer than of an actor. The
account given is that he was watching, learning,
making acquaintances, prudently preparing for
future success, rather than endeavoring to seize it
too greedily. In fact, there is reason to believe
that his thoughts were intent on far other matter
than the shaping of laws and statutes. For to this
period belongs the episode of Ann Rutledge. The
<!-- Image No 66 --><a name='Png066'></a><a name='Page044'></a><span class="pagenum">044</span>
two biographers whose personal knowledge is the
best regard this as the one real romance of Lincoln's
life. Heretofore he had held himself shyly
aloof from women's society, but this maiden won
his heart. She comes before posterity amid a glamour
of rhetorical description, which attributes to
her every grace of form and feature, every charm
of character and intellect. She was but a schoolgirl
of seventeen years when two men became her
lovers; a year or more afterward she became engaged
to one of them, but before they could be
married he made a somewhat singular excuse for
going to New York on family affairs. His absence
was prolonged and his letters became few. People
said that the girl had been deceived, and Lincoln
began to hope that the way was clearing for him.
But under the prolonged strain Miss Rutledge's
health broke down, and on August 25, 1835, she
died of brain fever. Lincoln was allowed to see
her as she lay near her end. The effect upon him
was grievous. Many declared him crazy, and his
friends feared that he might go so far as to take
his own life; they watched him closely, and one of
them at last kindly took him away from the scene
of his sufferings for a while, and bore him constant
and cheering company. In time the cloud passed,
but it seems certain that on only one or two other
occasions in his life did that deep melancholy,
which formed a permanent background to his temperament,
take such overmastering, such alarming
and merciless possession of him. He was afflicted
<!-- Image No 67 --><a name='Png067'></a><a name='Page045'></a><span class="pagenum">045</span>
sorely with a constitutional tendency to gloom, and
the evil haunted him all his life long. Like a dark
fog-bank it hung, always dull and threatening, on
the verge of his horizon, sometimes rolling heavily
down upon him, sometimes drawing off into a more
or less remote distance, but never wholly disappearing.
Every one saw it in his face and often felt
it in his manner, and few pictures of him have
been made so bad as not in some degree to present
it. The access of it which was brought on by this
unhappy love affair was somewhat odd and uncouth
in its manifestations, but was so genuine and sincere
that one feels that he was truly undergoing
the baptism of a great sorrow.</p>

<p>At no other point is there more occasion to note
this trait of character, which presents a curious
and interesting subject for study. Probably no
exhaustive solution is possible. One wanders off
into the mystery of human nature, loses his way in
the dimness of that which can be felt but cannot
be expressed, and becomes aware of even dimmer
regions beyond in which it is vain to grope. It is
well known that the coarse and rough side of life
among the pioneers had its reaction in a reserved
and at times morose habit, nearly akin to sadness,
at least in those who frequented the wilderness; it
was the expression of the influence of the vast,
desolate, and lonely nature amid which they passed
their lives. It is true that Lincoln was never a
backwoodsman, and never roved alone for long
periods among the shadowy forests and the limit-less
<!-- Image No 68 --><a name='Png068'></a><a name='Page046'></a><span class="pagenum">046</span>
prairies, so that their powerful and weird influences,
though not altogether remote, never bore
upon him in full force; yet their effect was everywhere
around him, and through others he imbibed it,
for his disposition was sensitive and sympathetic for
such purposes. That there was also a simple prosaic
physical inducement cannot be denied. Hardship
and daily discomfort in all the arrangements
of life counted for something, and especially so the
bad food, greasy, unwholesome, horribly cooked,
enough to afflict an ostrich with the blue devils
of dyspepsia. The denizen of the town devoured
messes vastly worse than the simple meal of the
hunter and trapper, and did not counteract the ill
effect by hard exercise in the free, inspiring air.
Such facts must be considered, though they diminish
the poetry which rhetoricians and sentimentalists
have cast over the melancholy of Lincoln's temperament.
Yet they fall far short of wholly accounting
for a gloom which many have loved to attribute to
the mysticism of a great destiny, as though the
awful weight of his immense task was making
itself felt in his strange, brooding nature long
years before any human prophet could have forecast
any part of that which was to come. In this
apparent vague consciousness of the oppression of
a great burden of toil, duty, and responsibility,
casting its shadow so far before, there is something
so fascinating to the imagination of man that we
cannot quite forego it, or accept any explanation
which would compel us altogether to part with it.
<!-- Image No 69 --><a name='Png069'></a><a name='Page047'></a><span class="pagenum">047</span>
The shuddering awe and terrible sense of fate,
which the grandeur of the Greek tragedies so powerfully
expresses, come to us when we contemplate
this strange cloud which never left Lincoln in any
year after his earliest youth, although some traits
in his character seemed often incomprehensibly to
violate it, and like rebellious spirits to do outrage
to it, while, in fact, they only made it the more
striking, picturesque, and mysterious. But, after
all explanations have been made, the conclusion
must be that there is no one and only thread to
guide us through the labyrinth to the heart of this
singular trait, and each of us must follow that
which his own nature renders intelligible or congenial
for him. To us, who know the awful closing
acts of his life-drama, it seems so appropriate that
there should be an impressive unity, and so an inevitable
backward influence working from the end
towards the beginning, that we cannot avoid, nor
would avoid, an instinctive belief that an occult
moral and mental condition already existed in the
years of Lincoln's life which we are now observing,
although the profound cause of that condition
lay wholly in the future, in the years which were
still far away. There is a charm in the very unreason
and mysticism of such a faith, and mankind
will never quite fail to fancy, if not actually to
believe, that the life which Lincoln had to live in
the future wrought in some inexplicable way upon
the life which he was living in the present. The
explanation is not more strange than the enigma.</p>

<!-- Image No 70 --><a name='Png070'></a>
<p><a name='Page048'></a><span class="pagenum">048</span>
Returning now to the narrative, an unpleasant
necessity is encountered. It must be confessed that
the atmosphere of romance which lingers around
this love-tale of the fair and sweet Ann Rutledge,
so untimely taken away, is somewhat attenuated
by the fact that only some fifteen months rolled
by after she was laid in the ground before Lincoln
was again intent upon matrimony. In the autumn
of 1836 Miss Mary Owens, of Kentucky, appeared
in New Salem,&mdash;a comely lass, with &quot;large blue
eyes,&quot; &quot;fine trimmings,&quot; and a long and varied
list of attractions. Lincoln immediately began to
pay court to her, but in an ungainly and morbid
fashion. It is impossible to avoid feeling that his
mind was not yet in a natural and healthy condition.
While offering to marry her, he advised her
not to have him. Upon her part she found him
&quot;deficient in those little links which make up the
chain of woman's happiness.&quot; So she would none
of him, but wedded another and became the mother
of some Confederate soldiers. Lincoln did not suffer
on this second occasion as he had done on the
first; and in the spring of 1838 he wrote upon the
subject one of the most unfortunate epistles ever
penned, in which he turned the whole affair into
coarse and almost ribald ridicule. In fact he
seems as much out of place in dealing with women
and with love as he was in place in dealing with
politicians and with politics, and it is pleasant to
return from the former to the latter topics.<a name='FNanchor_40_40'></a><a href='#Footnote_40_40'><sup>[40]</sup></a>
</p>

<!-- Image No 71 --><a name='Png071'></a>
<p><a name='Page049'></a><span class="pagenum">049</span>
The spring of 1836 found Lincoln again nominating
himself before the citizens of Sangamon
County, but for the last time. His party denounced
the caucus system as a &quot;Yankee contrivance, intended
to abridge the liberties of the people;&quot; but
they soon found that it would be as sensible to do
battle with pikes and bows, after the invention of
muskets and cannon, as to continue to oppose free
self-nomination to the Jacksonian method of nomination
by convention. In enjoying this last opportunity,
not only of presenting himself, but also of
constructing his own &quot;platform,&quot; Lincoln published
the following card:&mdash;</p>

<p>NEW SALEM, June 13, 1836.
<!-- Image No 72 --><a name='Png072'></a><a name='Page050'></a><span class="pagenum">050</span>
</p>

<p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE JOURNAL:&mdash;</p>

<p>In your paper of last Saturday I see a communication
over the signature of &quot;Many Voters&quot; in which the candidates
who are announced in the &quot;Journal&quot; are called
upon to &quot;show their hands.&quot; Agreed. Here's mine.</p>

<p>I go for all sharing the privileges of the government
who assist in bearing its burdens. Consequently, I go
for admitting all whites to the right of suffrage who pay
taxes or bear arms (by no means excluding females).</p>

<p>If elected, I shall consider the whole people of Sangamon
my constituents, as well those that oppose as those
that support me.</p>

<p>While acting as their representative, I shall be governed
by their will on all subjects upon which I have
the means of knowing what their will is; and upon all
others I shall do what my own judgment teaches me
will best advance their interests. Whether elected or
not, I go for distributing the proceeds of the sales of
public lands to the several States to enable our State, in
common with others, to dig canals and construct railroads
without borrowing money and paying the interest
on it.</p>

<p>If alive on the first Monday in November, I shall
vote for Hugh L. White for President.</p>

<p>Very respectfully,</p>

<p>A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>The canvass was conducted after the usual fashion,
with stump-speaking, fighting, and drinking.
Western voters especially fancied the joint debate
between rivals, and on such exciting occasions
were apt to come to the arbitrament of fists and
knives. But it is pleasant to hear that Lincoln
<!-- Image No 73 --><a name='Png073'></a><a name='Page051'></a><span class="pagenum">051</span>
calmed rather than excited such affrays, and that
once, when Ninian W. Edwards climbed upon a
table and screamed at his opponent the lie direct,
Lincoln replied by &quot;so fair a speech&quot; that it quelled
the discord. Henceforward he practiced a calm,
carefully-weighed, dispassionate style in presenting
facts and arguments. Even if he cultivated it
from appreciation of its efficiency, at least his skill
in it was due to the fact that it was congenial to
his nature, and that his mind worked instinctively
along these lines. His mental constitution, his
way of thinking, were so honest that he always
seemed to be a man sincerely engaged in seeking
the truth, and who, when he believed that he had
found it, would tell it precisely as he saw it, and
tell it all. This was the distinguishing trait or
habit which differentiates Lincoln from too many
other political speakers and writers in the country.
Yet with it he combined the character of a
practical politician and a stanch party man. No
party has a monopoly of truth and is always in the
right; but Lincoln, with the advantage of being
naturally fair-minded to a rare degree, understood
that the best ingenuity is fairness, and that the
second best ingenuity is the appearance of fairness.</p>

<p>A pleasant touch of his humor illumined this
campaign. George Forquer, once a Whig but
now a Democrat and an office-holder, had lately
built for himself the finest house in Springfield,
and had decorated it with the first lightning-rod
<!-- Image No 74 --><a name='Png074'></a><a name='Page052'></a><span class="pagenum">052</span>
ever seen in the neighborhood. One day, after
Forquer had been berating Lincoln as a young
man who must &quot;be taken down,&quot; Lincoln turned
to the audience with a few words: &quot;It is for you,
not for me, to say whether I am up or down. The
gentleman has alluded to my being a young man;<a name='FNanchor_41_41'></a><a href='#Footnote_41_41'><sup>[41]</sup></a>

I am older in years than I am in the tricks and
trades of politicians. I desire to live, and I desire
place and distinction as a politician; but I would
rather die now than, like the gentleman, live to
see the day when I should have to erect a lightning-rod
to protect a guilty conscience from an
offended God.&quot;</p>

<p>There are other stories of this campaign, amusing
and characteristic of the region and the times,
but which there is not room to repeat. The
result of it was that Sangamon County, hitherto
Democratic, was now won by the Whigs, and that
Lincoln had the personal satisfaction of leading
the poll. The county had in the legislature nine
representatives, tall fellows all, not one of them
standing less than six feet, so that they were nicknamed
&quot;the Long Nine.&quot; Such was their authority
that one of them afterward said: &quot;All the bad
or objectionable laws passed at that session of the
legislature, and for many years afterward, were
chargeable to the management and influence of
<!-- Image No 75 --><a name='Png075'></a><a name='Page053'></a><span class="pagenum">053</span>
'the Long Nine.'&quot; This was a damning confession,
for the &quot;bad and objectionable&quot; laws of that
session were numerous. A mania possessed the
people. The whole State was being cut up into
towns and cities and house-lots, so that town-lots
were said to be the only article of export.<a name='FNanchor_42_42'></a><a href='#Footnote_42_42'><sup>[42]</sup></a>
 A
system of internal improvements at the public
expense was pushed forward with incredible recklessness.
The State was to be &quot;gridironed&quot; with
thirteen hundred miles of railroad; the courses of
the rivers were to be straightened; and where nature
had neglected to supply rivers, canals were to
be dug. A loan of twelve millions of dollars was
authorized, and the counties not benefited thereby
received gifts of cash. The bonds were issued and
sent to the bankers of New York and of Europe,
and work was vigorously begun. The terrible
financial panic of 1837 ought to have administered
an early check to this madness. But it did
not. Resolutions of popular conventions instructed
legislators to institute &quot;a general system of internal
improvements,&quot; which should be &quot;commensurate
with the wants of the people;&quot; and the lawgivers
obeyed as implicitly as if each delegate was
lighting his steps by an Aladdin's lamp.</p>

<p>With this mad current Lincoln swam as wildly
and as ignorantly as did any of his comrades. He
was absurdly misplaced as a member of the Committee
on Finance. Never in his life did he show
<!-- Image No 76 --><a name='Png076'></a><a name='Page054'></a><span class="pagenum">054</span>
the slightest measure of &quot;money sense.&quot; He had,
however, declared his purpose to be governed by
the will of his constituents in all matters in which
he knew that will, and at this time he apparently
held the American theory that the multitude probably
possesses the highest wisdom, and that at
any rate the majority is entitled to have its way.
Therefore, in this ambitious enterprise of putting
Illinois at the very forefront of the civilized world
by an outburst of fine American energy, his ardor
was as warm as that of the warmest, and his intelligence
was as utterly misled as that of the most
ignorant. He declared his ambition to be &quot;the
DeWitt Clinton of Illinois.&quot; After the inevitable
crash had come, amid the perplexity of general ruin
and distress, he honestly acknowledged that he
had blundered very badly. Nevertheless, no vengeance
was exacted of him by the people; which
led Governor Ford to say that it is safer for a politician
to be wrong with his constituents than to
be right against them, and to illustrate this profound
truth by naming Lincoln among the &quot;spared
monuments of popular wrath.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Long Nine&quot; had in this legislature a task
peculiarly their own: to divide Sangamon County,
and to make Springfield instead of Vandalia the
state capital. Amid all the whirl of the legislation
concerning improvements Lincoln kept this
especial purpose always in view. It is said that
his skill was infinite, and that he never lost heart.
He gained the reputation of being the best &quot;log-roller&quot;
<!-- Image No 77 --><a name='Png077'></a><a name='Page055'></a><span class="pagenum">055</span>
in the legislature, and no measure got the
support of the &quot;Long Nine&quot; without a contract
for votes to be given in return for the removal of
the state capital. It is unfortunate that such
methods should enjoy the prestige of having been
conspicuously practiced by Abraham Lincoln, but
the evidence seems to establish the fact. That
there was anything objectionable in the skillful
performance of such common transactions as the
trading of votes probably never occurred to him,
being a professional politician, any more than it
did to his constituents, who triumphed noisily in
this success, and welcomed their candidates home
with great popular demonstrations of approval.<a name='FNanchor_43_43'></a><a href='#Footnote_43_43'><sup>[43]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>A more agreeable occurrence at this session is
the position taken by Lincoln concerning slavery,
a position which was looked upon with extreme
disfavor in those days in that State, and which he
voluntarily assumed when he was not called upon
to act or commit himself in any way concerning
the matter. During the session sundry resolutions
were passed, disapproving abolition societies and
doctrines, asserting the sacredness of the right of
property in slaves in the slave States, and alleging
that it would be against good faith to abolish
slavery in the District of Columbia without the
consent of the citizens of the District. Two days
<!-- Image No 78 --><a name='Png078'></a><a name='Page056'></a><span class="pagenum">056</span>
before the end of the session, March 3, 1837, Lincoln
introduced a strenuous protest. It bore only
one signature besides his own, and doubtless this
fact was fortunate for Lincoln, since it probably
prevented the document from attracting the attention
and resentment of a community which, at the
time, by no means held the opinion that there was
either &quot;injustice&quot; or &quot;bad policy&quot; in the great
&quot;institution&quot; of the South. It was within a few
months after this very time that the atrocious persecution
and murder of Lovejoy took place in the
neighboring town of Alton.</p>

<p>In such hours as he could snatch from politics
and bread-winning Lincoln had continued to study
law, and in March, 1837, he was admitted to the
bar. He decided to establish himself in Springfield,
where certainly he deserved a kindly welcome
in return for what he had done towards
making it the capital. It was a little town of
only between one and two thousand inhabitants;
but to Lincoln it seemed a metropolis. &quot;There
is a great deal of flourishing about in carriages
here,&quot; he wrote; there were also social distinctions,
and real aristocrats, who wore ruffled shirts,
and even adventured &quot;fair top-boots&quot; in the &quot;unfathomable&quot;
mud of streets which knew neither
sidewalks nor pavements.</p>

<p>Lincoln came into the place bringing all his
worldly belongings in a pair of saddle-bags. He
found there John T. Stuart, his comrade in the
Black Hawk campaign, engaged in the practice
<!-- Image No 79 --><a name='Png079'></a><a name='Page057'></a><span class="pagenum">057</span>
of the law. The two promptly arranged a partnership.
But Stuart was immersed in that too
common mixture of law and politics in which the
former jealous mistress is apt to take the traditional
revenge upon her half-hearted suitor. Such
happened in this case; and these two partners,
both making the same blunder of yielding imperfect
allegiance to their profession, paid the inevitable
penalty; they got perhaps work enough in
mere point of quantity, but it was neither interesting
nor lucrative. Such business, during the
four years which he passed with Stuart, did not
wean Lincoln from his natural fondness for matters
political. At the same time he was a member
of sundry literary gatherings and debating societies.
Such of his work as has been preserved
does not transcend the ordinary productions of a
young man trying his wings in clumsy flights of
oratory; but he had the excuse that the thunderous
declamatory style was then regarded in the
West as the only true eloquence. He learned
better, in course of time, and so did the West;
and it was really good fortune that he passed
through the hobbledehoy period in the presence
of audiences whose taste was no better than his
own.</p>

<p>Occasionally amid the tedium of these high-flown
commonplaces there opens a fissure through which
the inner spirit of the man looks out for an instant.
It is well known that Lincoln was politically ambitious;
his friends knew it, his biographers have
<!-- Image No 80 --><a name='Png080'></a><a name='Page058'></a><span class="pagenum">058</span>
said it, he himself avowed it. Now and again, in
these early days, when his horizon could hardly
have ranged beyond the state legislature and the
lower house of Congress, he uttered some sentences
which betrayed longings of a high moral grade,
and indicated that office and power were already
regarded by him as the opportunities for great
actions. Strenuous as ought to be the objection
to that tone in speaking of Lincoln which seems
to proceed from beneath the sounding-board of the
pulpit, and which uses him as a Sunday-school
figure to edify a piously admiring world, yet it
certainly seems a plain fact that his day-dreams
at this period foreshadowed the acts of his later
years, and that what he pleased himself with imagining
was not the acquirement of official position
but the achievement of some great benefit
for mankind. He did not, of course, expect to
do this as a philanthropist; for he understood
himself sufficiently to know that his road lay in
the public service. Accordingly he talks not as
Clarkson or Wilberforce, but as a public man, of
&quot;emancipating slaves,&quot; of eliminating slavery and
drunkenness from the land; at the same time he
speaks thus not as a politician shrewdly anticipating
the coming popular impulse, but as one
desiring to stir that impulse. When he said, in
his manifesto in 1832, that he had &quot;no other ambition
so great as that of being truly esteemed
by his fellow-men,&quot; he uttered words which in
the mouths of most politicians have the irritating
<!-- Image No 81 --><a name='Png081'></a><a name='Page059'></a><span class="pagenum">059</span><span class="pagenum">059</span>
effect of the dreariest and cheapest of platitudes;
but he obviously uttered them with the sincerity of
a deep inward ambition, that kind of an ambition
which is often kept sacred from one's nearest intimates.
Many side glimpses show him in this light,
and it seems to be the genuine and uncolored one.</p>

<p>In 1838 Lincoln was again elected a member of
the lower house of the legislature, and many are
the amusing stories told of the canvass. It was
in this year that he made sudden onslaught on the
demagogue Dick Taylor, and opening with a sudden
jerk the artful colonel's waistcoat, displayed
a glittering wealth of jewelry hidden temporarily
beneath it. There is also the tale of his friend
Baker haranguing a crowd in the store beneath
Lincoln's office. The audience differed with Baker,
and was about to punish him severely for the difference,
when Lincoln dangled down through a trap-door
in the ceiling, intimated his intention to share
in the fight if there was to be one, and brought
the audience to a more pacific frame of mind.
Such amenities of political debate at least tested
some of the qualities of the individual. The Whig
party made him their candidate for the speakership
and he came within one vote of being elected.<a name='FNanchor_44_44'></a><a href='#Footnote_44_44'><sup>[44]</sup></a>

He was again a member of the Finance Committee;
but financiering by those wise lawgivers was no
longer so lightsome and exuberant a task as it had
been. The hour of reckoning had come; and the
<!-- Image No 82 --><a name='Png082'></a><a name='Page060'></a><span class="pagenum">060</span>
business proved to be chiefly a series of humiliating
and futile efforts to undo the follies of the
preceding two and a half years. Lincoln shared
in this disagreeable labor, as he had shared in the
mania which had made it necessary. He admitted
that he was &quot;no financier,&quot; and gave evidence of
the fact by submitting a bill which did not deserve
to be passed, and was not. It can, however, be
said for him that he never favored repudiation, as
some of his comrades did.</p>

<p>In 1840<a name='FNanchor_45_45'></a><a href='#Footnote_45_45'><sup>[45]</sup></a>
 Lincoln was again elected, again was
the nominee of the Whig party for the speakership,
and again was beaten by Ewing, the Democratic
candidate, who mustered 46 votes against
36 for Lincoln. This legislature held only one
session, and apparently Holland's statement, that
&quot;no important business of general interest was
transacted,&quot; is a fair summary. Lincoln did only
one memorable thing, and that unfortunately was
discreditable. In a close and exciting contest, he,
with two other Whigs, jumped out of the window
in order to break a quorum. It is gratifying to
hear from the chronicler of the event, who was one
of the parties concerned, that &quot;Mr. Lincoln always
regretted that he entered into that arrangement, as
he deprecated everything that savored of the revolutionary.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_46_46'></a><a href='#Footnote_46_46'><sup>[46]</sup></a>
</p>

<p><!-- Image No 83 --><a name='Png083'></a><a name='Page061'></a><span class="pagenum">061</span>
The year 1840 was made lively throughout the
country by the spirited and rollicking campaign
which the Whigs made on behalf of General Harrison.
In that famous struggle for &quot;Tippecanoe
and Tyler too,&quot; the log cabin, hard cider, and the
'coon skin were the popular emblems which seemed
to lend picturesqueness and enthusiasm and a kind
of Western spirit to the electioneering everywhere
in the land. In Illinois Lincoln was a candidate
on the Whig electoral ticket, and threw himself
with great zeal into the congenial task of &quot;stumping&quot;
the State. Douglas was doing the same duty
on the other side, and the two had many encounters.
Of Lincoln's speeches only one has been preserved,<a name='FNanchor_47_47'></a><a href='#Footnote_47_47'><sup>[47]</sup></a>

and it leads to the conclusion that nothing
of value was lost when the others perished. The
effusion was in the worst style of the effervescent
and exuberant school of that region and generation.
Nevertheless, it may have had the greatest
merit which oratory can possess, in being perfectly
adapted to the audience to which it was addressed.
But rhetoric could not carry Illinois for the Whigs;
the Democrats cast the vote of the State.</p>

 The whole story of these two love affairs is given at great
length by Herndon and by Lamon. Other biographers deal lightly
with these episodes. Nicolay and Hay scantly refer to them, and,
in their admiration for Mr. Lincoln, even permit themselves to
speak of that most abominable letter to Mrs. Browning as &quot;grotesquely
comic.&quot; (Vol. i. p. 192.) It is certainly true that the
revelations of Messrs. Herndon and Lamon are painful, and in
part even humiliating; and it would be most satisfactory to give
these things the go-by. But this seems impossible; if one wishes
to study and comprehend the character of Mr. Lincoln, the strange
and morbid condition in which he was for some years at this time
cannot possibly be passed over. It may even be said that it would
be unfair to him to do so; and a truthful idea of him, on the
whole, redounds more to his credit than a maimed and mutilated
one, even though the mutilation seems to consist in lopping off and
casting out of sight a deformity. Psychologically, perhaps physiologically,
these episodes are interesting, and as aiding a comprehension
of Mr. Lincoln's nature they are indispensable; but
historically they are of no consequence, and I am glad that the
historical character of this work gives me the right to dwell upon
them lightly.</p></div>

<a name='CHAPTER_III'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h2>LOVE; A DUEL; LAW, AND CONGRESS</h2>

<p>Collaterally with law and politics, Lincoln
was at this time engaged with that almost grotesque
courtship which led to his marriage. The
story is a long and strange one; in its best gloss
it is not agreeable, and in its worst version it is
exceedingly disagreeable. In any form it is inexplicable,
save so far as the apparent fact that his
mind was somewhat disordered can be taken as an
explanation. In 1839 Miss Mary Todd, who had
been born in Lexington, Kentucky, December 13,
1818, came to Springfield to stay with her sister,
Mrs. Ninian W. Edwards. The Western biographers
describe her as &quot;gifted with rare talents,&quot;
as &quot;high-bred, proud, brilliant, witty,&quot; as &quot;aristocratic&quot;
and &quot;accomplished,&quot; and as coming from
a &quot;long and distinguished ancestral line.&quot; Later
in her career critics with more exacting standards
gave other descriptions. There is, however, no
doubt that in point of social position and acquirements
she stood at this time much above Lincoln.</p>

<p>Upon Lincoln's part it was a peculiar wooing, a
series of morbid misgivings as to the force of his
affection, of alternate ardor and coldness, advances
<!-- Image No 85 --><a name='Png085'></a><a name='Page063'></a><span class="pagenum">063</span>
and withdrawals, and every variety of strange language
and freakish behavior. In the course of it,
oddly enough, his omnipresent competitor, Douglas,
crossed his path, his rival in love as well as in
politics, and ultimately outstripped by him in each
alike. After many months of this queer, uncertain
zigzag progress, it was arranged that the marriage
should take place on January 1, 1841. At the
appointed hour the company gathered, the supper
was set out, and the bride, &quot;bedecked in veil and
silken gown, and nervously toying with the flowers
in her hair,&quot; according to the graphic description
of Mr. Herndon, sat in her sister's house awaiting
the coming of her lover. She waited, but he came
not, and soon his friends were searching the town
for him. Towards morning they found him. Some
said that he was insane; if he was not, he was at
least suffering from such a terrible access of his
constitutional gloom that for some time to come
it was considered necessary to watch him closely.
His friend Speed took him away upon a long visit
to Kentucky, from which he returned in a much
improved mental condition, but soon again came
under the influence of Miss Todd's attractions.</p>

<p>The memory of the absurd result of the recent
effort at marriage naturally led to the avoidance of
publicity concerning the second undertaking. So
nothing was said till the last moment; then the
license was procured, a few friends were hastily
notified, and the ceremony was performed, all
within a few hours, on November 4, 1842. A
<!-- Image No 86 --><a name='Png086'></a><a name='Page064'></a><span class="pagenum">064</span>
courtship marked by so many singularities was
inevitably prolific of gossip; and by all this tittle-tattle,
in which it is absolutely impossible to separate
probably a little truth from much fiction, the
bride suffered more than the groom. Among other
things it was asserted that Lincoln at last came to
the altar most reluctantly. One says that he was
&quot;pale and trembling, as if being driven to slaughter;&quot;
another relates that the little son of a friend,
noticing that his toilet had been more carefully
made than usual, asked him where he was going,
and that he gloomily responded: &quot;To hell, I suppose.&quot;
Probably enough, however, these anecdotes
are apocryphal; for why the proud and high-tempered
Miss Todd should have held so fast to
an unwilling lover, who had behaved so strangely
and seemed to offer her so little, is a conundrum
which has been answered by no better explanation
than the very lame one, that she foresaw his future
distinction. It was her misfortune that she failed
to make herself popular, so that no one has cared
in how disagreeable or foolish a position any story
places her. She was charged with having a sharp
tongue, a sarcastic wit, and a shrewish temper,
over which perilous traits she had no control. It
is related that her sister, Mrs. Edwards, opposed
the match, from a belief that the two were utterly
uncongenial, and later on this came to be the accepted
belief of the people at large. That Mrs.
Lincoln often severely harassed her husband always
has been and always will be believed. One
<!-- Image No 87 --><a name='Png087'></a><a name='Page065'></a><span class="pagenum">065</span>
would gladly leave the whole topic veiled in that
privacy which ought always to be accorded to
domestic relations which are supposed to be only
imperfectly happy; but his countrymen have not
shown any such respect to Mr. Lincoln, and it no
longer is possible wholly to omit mention of a matter
about which so much has been said and written.
Moreover, it has usually been supposed that the
influence of Mrs. Lincoln upon her husband was
unceasing and powerful, and that her moods and
her words constituted a very important element in
his life.<a name='FNanchor_48_48'></a><a href='#Footnote_48_48'><sup>[48]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>Another disagreeable incident of this period was
the quarrel with James A. Shields. In the summer
of 1842 sundry coarse assaults upon Shields,
attributed in great part, or wholly, to the so-called
<!-- Image No 88 --><a name='Png088'></a><a name='Page066'></a><span class="pagenum">066</span>
trenchant and witty pen of Miss Todd, appeared
in the Springfield &quot;Journal.&quot; Lincoln accepted
the responsibility for them, received and reluctantly
accepted a challenge, and selected broadswords as
the weapons! &quot;Friends,&quot; however, brought about
an &quot;explanation,&quot; and the conflict was avoided.
But ink flowed in place of blood, and the newspapers
were filled with a mass of silly, grandiloquent,
blustering, insolent, and altogether pitiable
stuff. All the parties concerned were placed in a
most humiliating light, and it is gratifying to hear
that Lincoln had at least the good feeling to be
heartily ashamed of the affair, so that he &quot;always
seemed willing to forget&quot; it. But every veil which
he ever sought to throw over anything concerning
himself has had the effect of an irresistible provocation
to drag the subject into the strongest glare
of publicity.<a name='FNanchor_49_49'></a><a href='#Footnote_49_49'><sup>[49]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>All the while, amid so many distractions, Lincoln
was seeking a livelihood at the bar. On April
<!-- Image No 89 --><a name='Png089'></a><a name='Page067'></a><span class="pagenum">067</span>
14, 1841, a good step was taken by dissolving the
partnership with Stuart and the establishment of
a new partnership with Stephen T. Logan, lately
judge of the Circuit Court of the United States,
and whom Arnold calls &quot;the head of the bar at
the capital.&quot; This gentleman, though not averse
to politics, was a close student, assiduous in his
attention to business, and very accurate and methodical
in his ways. Thus he furnished a shining
example of precisely the qualities which Lincoln
had most need to cultivate, and his influence upon
Lincoln was marked and beneficial. They continued
together until September 20, 1843, when
they separated, and on the same day Lincoln, heretofore
a junior, became the senior in a new partnership
with William H. Herndon. This firm was
never formally dissolved up to the day of Lincoln's
death.</p>

<p>When Lincoln was admitted to the bar the
practice of the law was in a very crude condition
in Illinois. General principles gathered from a
few text-books formed the simple basis upon
which lawyers tried cases and framed arguments
in improvised court-rooms. But the advance was
rapid and carried Lincoln forward with it. The
raw material, if the phrase may be pardoned, was
excellent; there were many men in the State who
united a natural aptitude for the profession with
high ability, ambition, and a progressive spirit.
Lincoln was brought in contact with them all,
whether they rode his circuit or not, because the
<!-- Image No 90 --><a name='Png090'></a><a name='Page068'></a><span class="pagenum">068</span>
federal courts were held only in Springfield.
Among them were Stephen A. Douglas, Lyman
Trumbull, afterward for a long while chairman of
the Judiciary Committee of the national Senate,
David Davis, afterward a senator, and an associate
justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States; O.H. Browning, Ninian W. Edwards,
Edward D. Baker, Justin Butterfield, Judge Logan,
and more. Precisely what position Lincoln
occupied among these men it is difficult to say
with accuracy, because it is impossible to know
just how much of the praise which has been bestowed
upon him is the language of eulogy or of
the brotherly courtesy of the bar, and how much
is a discriminating valuation of his qualities. That
in the foregoing list there were better and greater
lawyers than he is unquestionable; that he was
primarily a politician and only secondarily a lawyer
is equally beyond denial. He has been described
also as &quot;a case lawyer,&quot; that is to say, a
lawyer who studies each case as it comes to him
simply by and for itself, a method which makes the
practitioner rather than the jurist. That Lincoln
was ever learned in the science is hardly pretended.
In fact it was not possible that the divided allegiance
which he gave to his profession for a
score of years could have achieved such a result.<a name='FNanchor_50_50'></a><a href='#Footnote_50_50'><sup>[50]</sup></a>

<!-- Image No 91 --><a name='Png091'></a><a name='Page069'></a><span class="pagenum">069</span>
But it is said, and the well-known manner of his
mental operations makes it easy to believe, that
his arguments had a marvelous simplicity and
clearness, alike in thought and in expression. To
these traits they owed their great force; and a
legal argument can have no higher traits; fine-drawn
subtlety is undeniably an inferior quality.
Noteworthy above all else was his extraordinary
capacity for statement; all agree that his statement
of his case and his presentation of the facts
and the evidence were so plain and fair as to be
far more convincing than the argument which was
built upon them. Again it may be said that the
power to state in this manner is as high in the
order of intellectual achievement as anything
within forensic possibilities.</p>

<p>As an advocate Lincoln seems to have ranked
better than he did in the discussion of pure points
of law. When he warmed to his work his power
over the emotions of a jury was very great. A
less dignified but not less valuable capacity lay in
his humor and his store of illustrative anecdotes.
But the one trait, which all agree in attributing to
him and which above all others will redound to his
honor, at least in the mind of the layman, is that
he was only efficient when his client was in the
right, and that he made but indifferent work in
a wrong cause. He was pre&euml;minently the honest
lawyer, the counsel fitted to serve the litigant who
was justly entitled to win. His power of lucid
statement was of little service when the real facts
<!-- Image No 92 --><a name='Png092'></a><a name='Page070'></a><span class="pagenum">070</span>
were against him; and his eloquence seemed paralyzed
when he did not believe thoroughly that his
client had a just cause. He generally refused to
take cases unless he could see that as matter of
genuine right he ought to win them. People who
consulted him were at times bluntly advised to
withdraw from an unjust or a hard-hearted contention,
or were bidden to seek other counsel. He
could even go the length of leaving a case, while
actually conducting it, if he became satisfied of
unfairness on the part of his client; and when a
coadjutor won a case from which he had withdrawn
<i>in transitu</i>, so to speak, he refused to accept any
portion of the fee. Such habits may not meet
with the same measure of commendation from professional
men<a name='FNanchor_51_51'></a><a href='#Footnote_51_51'><sup>[51]</sup></a>
 which they will command on the
part of others; but those who are not members of
this ingenious profession, contemning the fine logic
which they fail to overcome, stubbornly insist upon
admiring the lawyer who refuses to subordinate
right to law. In this respect Lincoln accepted the
ideals of laymen rather than the doctrines of his
profession.<a name='FNanchor_52_52'></a><a href='#Footnote_52_52'><sup>[52]</sup></a>
</p>

<p><!-- Image No 93 --><a name='Png093'></a><a name='Page071'></a><span class="pagenum">071</span>
In the presidential campaign of 1844, in which
Henry Clay was the candidate of the Whig party,
Lincoln was nominated upon the Whig electoral
ticket. He was an ardent admirer of Clay and
he threw himself into this contest with great zeal.
Oblivious of courts and clients, he devoted himself
to &quot;stumping&quot; Illinois and a part of Indiana.
When Illinois sent nine Democratic electors to
vote for James K. Polk, his disappointment was
bitter. All the members of the defeated party had
a peculiar sense of personal chagrin upon this occasion,
and Lincoln felt it even more than others.
It is said that two years later a visit to Ashland
resulted in a disillusionment, and that his idol
then came down from its pedestal, or at least the
pedestal was made much lower.<a name='FNanchor_53_53'></a><a href='#Footnote_53_53'><sup>[53]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>In March, 1843, Lincoln had hopes that the
Whigs would nominate him as their candidate
for the national House of Representatives. In
the canvass he developed some strength, but not
quite enough, and the result was somewhat ludicrous,
for Sangamon County made him a delegate
to the nominating convention with instructions to
vote for one of his own competitors, Colonel Edward
D. Baker, the gallant gentleman and brilliant
orator who fell at Ball's Bluff. The prize was
finally carried off by Colonel John J. Hardin, who
afterward died at Buena Vista. By a change of
election periods the next convention was held in
1844, and this time Lincoln publicly declined to
<!-- Image No 94 --><a name='Png094'></a><a name='Page072'></a><span class="pagenum">072</span>
make a contest for the nomination against Colonel
Baker, who accordingly received it and was elected.
It has been said that an agreement was made
between Hardin, Baker, Lincoln, and Judge Logan,
whereby each should be allowed one term
in Congress, without competition on the part of
any of the others; but the story does not seem
altogether trustworthy, nor wholly corroborated
by the facts. Possibly there may have been a
courteous understanding between them. It has,
however, been spoken of as a very reprehensible
bargain, and Lincoln has been zealously defended
against the reproach of having entered into it.
Why, if indeed it ever was made, it had this
objectionable complexion is a point in the inscrutable
moralities of politics which is not plain to
those uninitiated in these ethical mysteries.</p>

<p>In the year 1846 Lincoln again renewed his
pursuit of the coveted honor, as Holland very
properly puts it. Nothing is more absurd than
statements to the purport that he was &quot;induced
to accept&quot; the nomination, statements which he
himself would have heard with honest laughter.
Only three years ago<a name='FNanchor_54_54'></a><a href='#Footnote_54_54'><sup>[54]</sup></a>
 he had frankly written to
a friend: &quot;Now, if you should hear any one say
that Lincoln don't want to go to Congress, I wish
you, as a personal friend of mine, would tell him
you have reason to believe he is mistaken. The
truth is I would [should] like to go very much.&quot;
Now, the opportunity being at hand, he spared no
<!-- Image No 95 --><a name='Png095'></a><a name='Page073'></a><span class="pagenum">073</span>
pains to compass it. In spite of the alleged agreement
Hardin made reconnoissances in the district,
which Lincoln met with counter-manifestations so
vigorous that on February 26 Hardin withdrew,
and on May 1 Lincoln was nominated. Against
him the Democrats set Peter Cartwright, the famous
itinerant preacher of the Methodists, whose
strenuous and popular eloquence had rung in the
ears of every Western settler. Stalwart, aggressive,
possessing all the qualities adapted to win the
good-will of such a constituency, the Apostle of the
West was a dangerous antagonist. But Lincoln
had political capacity in a rare degree. Foresight
and insight, activity and the power to organize and
to direct, were his. In this campaign his eye was
upon every one; individuals, newspaper editors,
political clubs, got their inspiration and their guidance
from him.<a name='FNanchor_55_55'></a><a href='#Footnote_55_55'><sup>[55]</sup></a>
 Such thoroughness deserved and
achieved an extraordinary success; and at the
polls, in August, the district gave him a majority
of 1,511. In the latest presidential campaign it
had given Clay a majority of 914; and two years
later it gave Taylor a majority of 1,501. Sangamon
County gave Lincoln a majority of 690, the
largest given to any candidate from 1836 to 1850,
inclusive. Moreover, Lincoln was the only Whig
who secured a place in the Illinois delegation.</p>

<p>Though elected in the summer of 1846, it was
not until December 6, 1847, that the Thirtieth
<!-- Image No 96 --><a name='Png096'></a><a name='Page074'></a><span class="pagenum">074</span>
Congress began its first session. Robert C. Winthrop
was chosen speaker of the House, by 110
votes out of 218. The change in the political condition
was marked; in the previous House the
Democrats had numbered 142 and the Whigs
only 75; in this House the Whigs were 116, the
Democrats 108. Among the members were John
Quincy Adams, Andrew Johnson, Alexander H.
Stephens, Howell Cobb, David Wilmot, Jacob Collamer,
Robert Toombs, with many more scarcely
less familiar names. The Mexican war was drawing
towards its close,<a name='FNanchor_56_56'></a><a href='#Footnote_56_56'><sup>[56]</sup></a>
 and most of the talking
in Congress had relation to it. The whole Whig
party denounced it at the time, and the nation has
been more than half ashamed of it ever since. By
adroit manoeuvres Polk had forced the fight upon
a weak and reluctant nation, and had made to his
own people false statements as to both the facts
and the merits of the quarrel. The rebuke which
they had now administered, by changing the large
Democratic majority into a minority, &quot;deserves,&quot;
says von Holst, &quot;to be counted among the most
meritorious proofs of the sound and honorable
feeling of the American nation.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_57_57'></a><a href='#Footnote_57_57'><sup>[57]</sup></a>
 But while the
<!-- Image No 97 --><a name='Png097'></a><a name='Page075'></a><span class="pagenum">075</span>
administration had thus smirched the inception
and the whole character of the war with meanness
and dishonor, the generals and the army were winning
abundant glory for the national arms. Good
strategy achieved a series of brilliant victories,
and fortunately for the Whigs General Taylor and
General Scott, together with a large proportion of
the most distinguished regimental officers, were of
their party. This aided them essentially in their
policy, which was, to denounce the entering into
the war but to vote all necessary supplies for its
vigorous prosecution.</p>

<p>Into this scheme of his party Lincoln entered
with hearty concurrence. A week after the House
met he closed a letter to his partner with the
remark: &quot;As you are all so anxious for me to
distinguish myself, I have concluded to do so
before long,&quot; and what he said humorously he
probably meant seriously. Accordingly he soon
afterward<a name='FNanchor_58_58'></a><a href='#Footnote_58_58'><sup>[58]</sup></a>
 introduced a series of resolutions,
which, under the nickname of &quot;The Spot Resolutions,&quot;
attracted some attention. Quoting in his
preamble sundry paragraphs of the President's
message of May 11, 1846, to the purport that
Mexico had &quot;invaded <i>our territory</i>&quot; and had
&quot;shed the blood of our citizens on <i>our own soil</i>&quot;
he then requested the President to state &quot;<i>the spot</i>&quot;
where these and other alleged occurrences had
taken place. His first &quot;little speech&quot; was on &quot;a
post-office question of no general interest;&quot; and
<!-- Image No 98 --><a name='Png098'></a><a name='Page076'></a><span class="pagenum">076</span>
he found himself &quot;about as badly scared and no
worse&quot; than when he spoke in court. So a little
later, January 12, 1848, he ventured to call up his
resolutions and to make an elaborate speech upon
them.<a name='FNanchor_59_59'></a><a href='#Footnote_59_59'><sup>[59]</sup></a>
 It was not a very great or remarkable
speech, but it was a good one, and not conceived
in the fervid and florid style which defaced his
youthful efforts; he spoke sensibly, clearly, and
with precision of thought; he sought his strength
in the facts, and went in straight pursuit of the
truth; his best intellectual qualities were plainly
visible. The resolutions were not acted upon, and
doubtless their actual passage had never been expected;
but they were a good shot well placed;
and they were sufficiently noteworthy to save Lincoln
from being left among the herd of the nobodies
of the House.</p>

<p>In view of his future career, but for no other
reason, a brief paragraph is worth quoting. He
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Any people anywhere, being inclined and having
the power, have the <i>right</i> to rise up and shake
off the existing government, and form a new one
that suits them better. This is a most valuable, a
most sacred right,&mdash;a right which, we hope and
believe, is to liberate the world. Nor is this right
confined to cases in which the whole people of an
existing government may choose to exercise it.
Any portion of such people, that <i>can</i>, may revolutionize,
and make their <i>own</i> of so much of the
<!-- Image No 99 --><a name='Png099'></a><a name='Page077'></a><span class="pagenum">077</span>
territory as they inhabit.&quot; This doctrine, so comfortably
applied to Texas in 1848, seemed unsuitable
for the Confederate States in 1861. But
possibly the point lay in the words, &quot;having the
power,&quot; and &quot;can,&quot; for the Texans &quot;had the
power&quot; and &quot;could,&quot; and the South had it not
and could not; and so Lincoln's practical proviso
saved his theoretical consistency; though he must
still have explained how either Texas or the South
could know whether they &quot;had the power,&quot; and
&quot;could,&quot; except by trial.</p>

<p>Lincoln's course concerning the war and the
administration did not please his constituents.
With most of the Whigs he voted for Ashmun's
amendment, which declared that the war had been
&quot;unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced
by the President.&quot; But soon he heard that the
people in Springfield were offended at a step
which might weaken the administration in time of
stress; and even if the President had transcended
the Constitution, they preferred to deny rather
than to admit the fact. When Douglas afterward
charged Lincoln with lack of patriotism, Lincoln
replied that he had not chosen to &quot;skulk,&quot; and,
feeling obliged to vote, he had voted for &quot;the
truth&quot; rather than for &quot;a lie.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_60_60'></a><a href='#Footnote_60_60'><sup>[60]</sup></a>
 He remarked
also that he, with the Whigs generally, always
voted for the supply bills. He took and maintained
his position with entire manliness and honesty, and
<!-- Image No 100 --><a name='Png100'></a><a name='Page078'></a><span class="pagenum">078</span>
stated his principles with perfect clearness, neither
shading nor abating nor coloring by any conciliatory
or politic phrase. It was a question of conscience,
and he met it point-blank. Many of his
critics remained dissatisfied, and it is believed that
his course cost the next Whig candidate in the district
votes which he could not afford to lose. It is
true that another paid this penalty, yet Lincoln
himself would have liked well to take his chance as
the candidate. To those &quot;who desire that I should
be reflected,&quot; he wrote to Herndon, &quot;I can say, as
Mr. Clay said of the annexation of Texas, that
'<i>personally</i> I would not object.' ... If it should
so happen <i>that nobody else wishes to be elected</i>, I
could not refuse the people the right of sending
me again. But to enter myself as a competitor of
others, or to authorize any one so to enter me, is
what my word and honor forbid.&quot; It did so happen
that Judge Logan, whose turn it seemed to be,
wished the nomination and received it. He was,
however, defeated, and probably paid the price of
Lincoln's scrupulous honesty.</p>

<p>In the canvassing of the spring of 1848 Lincoln
was an ardent advocate for the nomination of
General Taylor as the Whig candidate for the
presidency; for he appreciated how much greater
was the strength of the military hero, with all that
could be said against him, than was that of Mr.
Clay, whose destiny was so disappointingly non-presidential.
When the nomination went according
to his wishes, he entered into the campaign
<!-- Image No 101 --><a name='Png101'></a><a name='Page079'></a><span class="pagenum">079</span>
with as much zeal as his congressional duties would
permit,&mdash;indeed, with somewhat an excess of zeal,
for he delivered on the floor of the House an
harangue in favor of the general which was little
else than a stump speech, admirably adapted for
a backwoods audience, but grossly out of place
where it was spoken. He closed it with an assault
on General Cass, as a military man, which was
designed to be humorous, and has, therefore, been
quoted with unfortunate frequency. So soon as
Congress adjourned he was able to seek a more
legitimate arena in New England, whither he
went at once and delivered many speeches, none
of which have been preserved.</p>

<p>Lincoln's position upon the slavery question in
this Congress was that of moderate hostility. In
the preceding Congress, the Twenty-ninth, the
famous Wilmot Proviso, designed to exclude slavery
from any territory which the United States
should acquire from Mexico, had passed the House
and had been killed in the Senate. In the Thirtieth
Congress efforts to the same end were renewed
in various forms, always with Lincoln's favor.
He once said that he had voted for the principle
of the Wilmot Proviso &quot;about forty-two times,&quot;
which, if not an accurate mathematical computation,
was a vivid expression of his stanch adherence
to the doctrine. At the second session Mr.
Lincoln voted against a bill to prohibit the slave
trade in the District of Columbia, because he did
not approve its form; and then introduced another
<!-- Image No 102 --><a name='Png102'></a><a name='Page080'></a><span class="pagenum">080</span>
bill, which he himself had drawn. This prohibited
the bringing slaves into the District, except
as household servants by government officials who
were citizens of slave States; it also prohibited
selling them to be taken away from the District;
children born of slave mothers after January 1,
1850, were to be subject to temporary apprenticeship
and finally to be made free; owners of slaves
might collect from the government their full cash
value as the price of their freedom; fugitive slaves
escaping into Washington and Georgetown were
to be returned; finally the measure was to be submitted
to popular vote in the District. This was
by no means a measure of abolitionist coloring,
although Lincoln obtained for it the support of
Joshua R. Giddings, who believed it &quot;as good a
bill as we could get at this time,&quot; and was &quot;willing
to pay for slaves in order to save them from
the Southern market.&quot; It recognized the right of
property in slaves, which the Abolitionists denied;
also it might conceivably be practicable, a characteristic
which rarely marked the measures of the
Abolitionists, who professed to be pure moralists
rather than practical politicians. From this first
move to the latest which he made in this great
business, Lincoln never once broke connection with
practicability. On this occasion he had actually
succeeded in obtaining from Mr. Seaton, editor
of the &quot;National Intelligencer&quot; and mayor of
Washington, a promise of support, which gave
him a little prospect of success. Later, however,
<!-- Image No 103 --><a name='Png103'></a><a name='Page081'></a><span class="pagenum">081</span>
the Southern Congressmen drew this influential
gentleman to their side, and thereby rendered the
passage of the bill impossible; at the close of the
session it lay with the other corpses in that grave
called &quot;the table.&quot;</p>

<p>When his term of service in Congress was over
Lincoln sought, but failed to obtain, the position
of Commissioner of the General Lands Office.
He was offered the governorship of the newly
organized Territory of Oregon; but this, controlled
by the sensible advice of his wife, he fortunately
declined.</p>

 Lamon, pp. 238-252, tells the story of Lincoln's marriage at
great length, sparing nothing; he liberally sets forth the gossip
and the stories; he quotes the statements of witnesses who knew
both parties at the time, and he gives in full much correspondence.
The spirit and the letter of his account find substantial corroboration
in the narrative of Herndon, pp. 206-231. So much original
material and evidence of acquaintances have been gathered by
these two writers, and their own opportunities of knowing the
truth were so good, that one seems not at liberty to reject the <i>substantial</i>
correctness of their version. Messrs. Nicolay and Hay, vol.
i. ch. 11, give a narrative for the most part in their own language.
Their attempt throughout to mitigate all that is disagreeable is
so obvious, not only in substance but in the turn of every phrase,
that it is impossible to accept their chapter as a picture either
free from obscurity or true in color, glad as one might be to do so.
Arnold, pp. 68, 72, and Holland, p. 90, simply mention the marriage,
and other biographers would have done well to imitate this
forbearance; but too much has been said to leave this course now
open.</p></div>

<p><a name='Footnote_49_49'></a><a href='#FNanchor_49_49'>[49]</a>
 It is fair to say that my view of this &quot;duel&quot; is not that of
other writers. Lamon, p. 260, says that &quot;the scene is one of
transcendent interest.&quot; Herndon, p. 260, calls it a &quot;serio-comic
affair.&quot; Holland, pp. 87-89, gives a brief, deprecatory account
of what he calls &quot;certainly a boyish affair.&quot; Arnold, pp. 69-72,
treats it simply enough, but puts the whole load of the ridicule
upon Shields. Nicolay and Hay, vol. i. ch. 12, deal with it gravely,
and in the same way in which, in the preceding chapter, they deal
with the marriage; that is to say, they eschew the production of
original documents, and, by their own gloss, make a good story for
Lincoln and a very bad one for Shields; they speak lightly of the
&quot;ludicrousness&quot; of the affair. To my mind the opinion which
Lincoln himself held is far more correct than that expressed by
any of his biographers.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h2>NORTH AND SOUTH</h2>

<p>The Ordinance of 1787 established that slavery
should never exist in any part of that vast northwestern
territory which had then lately been ceded
by sundry States to the Confederation. This Ordinance
could not be construed otherwise than as
an integral part of the transaction of cession, and
was forever unalterable, because it represented in
a certain way a part of the consideration in a contract,
and was also in the nature of a declaration
of trust undertaken by the Congress of the Confederation
with the granting States. The article
&quot;was agreed to without opposition;&quot; but almost
contemporaneously, in the sessions of that convention
which framed the Constitution, debate waxed
hot upon the topic which was then seen to present
grave obstacles to union. It was true that many
of the wisest Southerners of that generation regarded
the institution as a menacing misfortune;
they however could not ignore the fact that it
was a &quot;misfortune&quot; of that peculiar kind which
was endured with much complacency by those
afflicted by it; and it was equally certain that the
great body of slave-owners would resent any effort
<!-- Image No 105 --><a name='Png105'></a><a name='Page083'></a><span class="pagenum">083</span>
to relieve them of their burden. Hence there were
placed in the Constitution provisions in behalf of
slavery which involved an admission that the institution
needed protection, and should receive it.
The idea of protection implied the existence of
hostility either of men or of circumstances, or of
both. Thus by the Ordinance and the Constitution,
taken together, there was already indirectly
recognized an antagonism between the institutions,
interests, and opinions of the South and those of
the North.</p>

<p>Slowly this feeling of opposition grew. The
first definite mark of the growth was the struggle
over the admission of Missouri, in 1820. This was
settled by the famous &quot;Compromise,&quot; embodied in
the Act of March 6, 1820, whereby the people of
the Territory of Missouri were allowed to frame a
state government with no restriction against slavery;
but a clause also enacted that slavery should
never be permitted in any part of the remainder of
the public territory lying north of the parallel of
36&deg; 30'. By its efficiency during thirty-four years
of constantly increasing strain this legislation was
proved to be a remarkable political achievement;
and as the people saw it perform so long and so
well a service so vital they came to regard it as
only less sacred than the Constitution itself. Even
Douglas, who afterward led in repealing it, declared
that it had an &quot;origin akin to the Constitution,&quot;
and that it was &quot;canonized in the hearts
of the American people as a sacred thing.&quot; Yet
<!-- Image No 106 --><a name='Png106'></a><a name='Page084'></a><span class="pagenum">084</span>
during the long quietude which it brought, each
section kept a jealous eye upon the other; and
especially was the scrutiny of the South uneasy,
for she saw ever more and more plainly the disturbing
truth that her institution needed protection.
Being in derogation of natural right, it was
peculiarly dependent upon artificial sustention; the
South would not express the condition in this
language, but acted upon the idea none the less.
It was true that the North was not aggressive
towards slavery, but was observing it with much
laxity and indifference; that the crusading spirit
was sleeping soundly, and even the proselyting
temper was feeble. But this state of Northern
feeling could not relieve the South from the harassing
consciousness that slavery needed not only
toleration, but positive <i>protection</i> at the hands of
a population whose institutions were naturally
antagonistic to the slave idea. This being the
case, she must be alarmed at seeing that population
steadily outstripping her own in numbers and
wealth.<a name='FNanchor_61_61'></a><a href='#Footnote_61_61'><sup>[61]</sup></a>
 Since she could not possibly even hold
this disproportion stationary, her best resource
seemed to be to endeavor to keep it practically
harmless by maintaining a balance of power in the
government. Thus it became unwritten law that
slave States and free States must be equal in number,
so that the South could not be outvoted in the
<!-- Image No 107 --><a name='Png107'></a><a name='Page085'></a><span class="pagenum">085</span>
Senate. This system was practicable for a while,
yet not a very long while; for the North was filling
up that great northwestern region, which was
eternally dedicated to freedom, and full-grown
communities could not forever be kept outside the
pale of statehood. On the other hand, apart from
any question of numbers, the South could make
no counter-expansion, because she lay against a
foreign country. After a time, however, Texas
opportunely rebelled against Mexico, and then the
opportunity for removing this obstruction was too
obvious and too tempting to be lost. A brief
period of so-called independence on the part of
Texas was followed by the annexation of her territory
to the United States,<a name='FNanchor_62_62'></a><a href='#Footnote_62_62'><sup>[62]</sup></a>
 with the proviso that
from her great area might in the future be cut off
still four other States. Slavery had been abolished
in all Mexican territory, and Texas had been properly
a &quot;free&quot; country; but in becoming a part of
the United States she became also a slave State.</p>

<p>Mexico had declared that annexation of Texas
would constitute a <i>casus belli</i>, yet she was wisely
laggard in beginning vindictive hostilities against
a power which could so easily whip her, and she
probably never would have done so had the United
States rested content with an honest boundary
line. But this President Polk would not do, and
by theft and falsehood he at last fairly drove the
Mexicans into a war, in which they were so excessively
beaten that the administration found itself
<!-- Image No 108 --><a name='Png108'></a><a name='Page086'></a><span class="pagenum">086</span>
able to gather more plunder than it had expected.
By the treaty of peace the United States not only
extended unjustly the southwestern boundary of
Texas, but also got New Mexico and California.
To forward this result, Polk had asked the House
to place $2,000,000 at his disposal. Thereupon,
as an amendment to the bill granting this sum,
Wilmot introduced his famous proviso, prohibiting
slavery in any part of the territory to be acquired.
Repeatedly and in various shapes was the substance
of this proviso voted upon, but always it was voted
down. Though New Mexico had come out from
under the rule of despised Mexico as &quot;free&quot; country,
a contrary destiny was marked out for it in its
American character. A plausible suggestion was
made to extend the sacred line of the Missouri
Compromise westward to the Pacific Ocean; and
very little of the new country lay north of that line.
By all these transactions the South seemed to
be scoring many telling points in its game. They
were definite points, which all could see and estimate;
yet a price, which was considerable, though
less definite, less easy to see and to estimate, had
in fact been paid for them; for the antagonism of
the rich and teeming North to the Southern institution
and to the Southern policy for protecting it
had been spread and intensified to a degree which
involved a menace fully offsetting the Southern
territorial gain. One of the indications of this
state of feeling was the organization of the &quot;Free
Soil&quot; party.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 109 --><a name='Png109'></a><a name='Page087'></a><span class="pagenum">087</span>
Almost simultaneously with this important advancement
of the Southern policy there occurred
an event, operative upon the other side, which certainly
no statesman could have foreseen. Gold
was discovered in California, and in a few months
a torrent of immigrants poured over the land.
The establishment of an efficient government became
a pressing need. In Congress they debated
the matter hotly; the friends of the Wilmot proviso
met in bitter conflict the advocates of the
westward extension of the line of 36&deg; 30'. Neither
side could prevail, and amid intense excitement
the Thirtieth Congress expired. For the
politicians this was well enough, but for the Californians
organization was such an instant necessity
that they now had to help themselves to it. So
they promptly elected a Constitutional Convention,
which assembled on September 1, 1849, and adjourned
on October 13. Though this body held
fifteen delegates who were immigrants from slave
States, yet it was unanimous in presenting a Constitution
which prohibited slavery, and which was
at once accepted by a popular vote of 12,066 yeas
against 811 nays.</p>

<p>Great then was the consternation of the Southern
leaders when Californian delegates appeared
immediately upon the assembling of the Thirty-first
Congress, and asked for admission beneath
this unlooked-for &quot;free&quot; charter of statehood.
The shock was aggravated by the fact that New
Mexico, actually instigated thereto by the slaveholding
<!-- Image No 110 --><a name='Png110'></a><a name='Page088'></a><span class="pagenum">088</span>
President Taylor himself, was likely to
follow close in the Californian foot-tracks. The
admission of Texas had for a moment disturbed
the senatorial equilibrium between North and
South, which, however, had quickly been restored
by the admission of Wisconsin. But the South
had nothing to offer to counterbalance California
and New Mexico, which were being suddenly
filched from her confident expectation. In this
emergency those extremists in the South who offset
the Abolitionists at the North fell back upon
the appalling threat of disunion, which could
hardly be regarded as an idle extravagance of the
&quot;hotspurs,&quot; since it was substantially certain that
the Senate would never admit California with her
anti-slavery Constitution; and thus a real crisis
seemed at hand. Other questions also were cast
into the seething caldron. Texas, whose boundaries
were as uncertain as the ethics of politicians,
set up a claim which included nearly all New
Mexico, and so would have settled the question
of slavery for that region at least. Further, the
South called for a Fugitive Slave Law sufficiently
stringent to be serviceable. Also, in encountering
the Wilmot proviso, Southern statesmen had asserted
the doctrine, far-reaching and subversive of
established ideas and of enacted laws, that Congress
could not constitutionally interfere with the
property-rights of citizens of the United States
in the Territories, and that slaves were property.
Amid such a confused and violent hurly-burly the
<!-- Image No 111 --><a name='Png111'></a><a name='Page089'></a><span class="pagenum">089</span>
perplexed body of order-loving citizens were, with
reason, seriously alarmed.</p>

<p>To the great relief of these people and to the
equal disgust of the extremist politicians, Henry
Clay, the &quot;great compromiser,&quot; was now announced
to appear once more in the r&ocirc;le which all felt that
he alone could play. He came with much dramatic
effect; an aged and broken man, he emerged from
the retirement in which he seemed to have sought
a brief rest before death should lay him low, and
it was with an impressive air of sadness and of
earnestness that he devoted the last remnants of
his failing strength to save a country which he had
served so long. His friends feared that he might
not survive even a few months to reach the end of
his patriotic task. On January 29, 1850, he laid
before the Senate his &quot;comprehensive scheme of
adjustment.&quot; But it came not as oil upon the
angry waters; every one was offended by one or
another part of it, and at once there opened a war
of debate which is among the most noteworthy and
momentous in American history. Great men who
belonged to the past and great men who were to
belong to the future shared in the exciting controversies,
which were prolonged over a period of
more than half a year. Clay was constantly on
his feet, doing battle with a voice which gained
rather than lost force from its pathetic feebleness.
&quot;I am here,&quot; he solemnly said, &quot;expecting soon to
go hence, and owing no responsibility but to my
own conscience and to God.&quot; Jefferson Davis
<!-- Image No 112 --><a name='Png112'></a><a name='Page090'></a><span class="pagenum">090</span>
spoke for the extension westward of the Missouri
Compromise line to the Pacific Ocean, with a proviso
positively establishing slavery south of that
line. Calhoun, from the edge of the grave, into
which only a few weeks later he was to fall, once
more faced his old adversaries. On March 4 he
sat beside Mason of Virginia, while that gentleman
read for him to a hushed audience the speech
which he himself was too weak to deliver. Three
days later Webster uttered that speech which made
the seventh day of March almost as famous in
the history of the United States as the Ides of
the same month had been in that of Rome. In the
eyes of the anti-slavery men of New England the
fall of Webster was hardly less momentous than
the fall of Caesar had appeared in the Eternal City.
Seward also spoke a noteworthy speech, bringing
upon himself infinite abuse by his bold phrase, <i>a
higher law than the Constitution</i>. Salmon P.
Chase followed upon the same side, in an exalted
and prophetic strain. In that momentous session
every man gave out what he felt to be his best,
while anxious and excited millions devoured every
word which the newspapers reported to them.</p>

<p>Clay had imprudently gathered the several matters
of his Compromise into one bill, which was
soon sneeringly nicknamed &quot;the Omnibus Bill.&quot;
It was sorely harassed by amendments, and when
at last, on July 31, the Omnibus reached the end
of its journey, it contained only one passenger, viz.,
a territorial government for Utah. Its trip had
<!-- Image No 113 --><a name='Png113'></a><a name='Page091'></a><span class="pagenum">091</span>
apparently ended in utter failure. But a careful
study of individual proclivities showed that not
improbably those measures might be passed one
by one which could not be passed in combination.
In this hope, five several bills, being all the ejected
contents of the Omnibus, were brought forward,
and each in turn had the success which had been
denied to them together. First: Texas received
$10,000,000, and for this price magnanimously relinquished
her unfounded claim upon New Mexico.
Second: California was admitted as a free State.
Third: New Mexico was organized as a Territory,
with the proviso that when she should form a state
constitution the slavery question should be determined
by the people, and that during her territorial
existence the question of property in a slave
should be left undisturbed by congressional action,
to be determined by the Supreme Court of the
United States. Fourth: A more efficient Fugitive
Slave Law was passed. Fifth: Slave trading in
the District of Columbia was abolished. Such
were the terms of an arrangement in which every
man saw so much which he himself disliked that
he felt sure that others must be satisfied. Each
plumed himself on his liberality in his concessions
nobly made in behalf of public harmony. &quot;The
broad basis,&quot; says von Holst, &quot;on which the compromise
of 1850 rested, was the conviction of the
great majority of the people, both North and South,
that it was fair, reasonable, and patriotic to come
to a friendly understanding.&quot;</p>

<p><!-- Image No 114 --><a name='Png114'></a><a name='Page092'></a><span class="pagenum">092</span>
Thus in the midsummer of 1850 did the nation,
with intense relief, see the imminent disaster of
civil discord averted,&mdash;or was it only postponed?
It was ominous that no men who were deeply in
earnest in public affairs were sincerely satisfied.
The South saw no gain which offset the destruction
of the balance of power by the admission of California.
Thinking men at the North were alarmed
at the recognition of the principle of non-intervention
by Congress concerning slavery in the Territories,
a principle which soon, under the seductive
title of &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; in the Territories,
threatened even that partial restriction heretofore
given by the Missouri Compromise. Neither party
felt sufficiently secure of the strength of its legal
position to be altogether pleased at seeing the
doctrine of treating the slave in the Territories as
&quot;property&quot; cast into the lottery of the Supreme
Court. Lincoln recognized the futility of this
whole arrangement, and said truly that the slavery
question could &quot;never be successfully compromised.&quot;
Yet he accepted the situation, with
the purpose of making of it the best that was possible.
The mass of the people, less far-sighted,
were highly gratified at the passing of the great
danger; refused to recognize that a more temporary
compromise was never patched up to serve a
turn; and applauded it so zealously that in preparing
for the presidential campaign of 1852 each
party felt compelled to declare emphatically&mdash;what
all wise politicians knew to be false&mdash;the &quot;finality&quot;
<!-- Image No 115 --><a name='Png115'></a><a name='Page093'></a><span class="pagenum">093</span>
of the great Compromise of 1850. Never, never
more was there to be a revival of the slavery
agitation! Yet, at the same time, it was instinctively
felt that the concord would cease at once if
the nation should not give to the South a Democratic
President! In this campaign Lincoln made
a few speeches in Illinois in favor of Scott; but
Herndon says that they were not very satisfactory
efforts. Franklin Pierce was chosen, and slavery
could have had no better man.</p>

<p>This doctrine of non-intervention by Congress
with slavery in the Territories lay as the seed of
mortal disease imbedded in the vitals of the great
Compromise even at the hour of its birth. All
the howlings of the political medicine-men in the
halls of Congress, and in the wigwams where the
party platforms were manufactured, could not defer
the inevitable dissolution. The rapid peopling
of the Pacific coast already made it imperative to
provide some sort of governmental organization for
the sparsely inhabited regions lying between these
new lands and the fringe of population near the
Mississippi. Accordingly bills were introduced
to establish as a Territory the region which was
afterward divided between Kansas and Nebraska;
but at two successive sessions they failed to pass,
more, as it seemed, from lack of interest than from
any open hostility. In the course of debate it was
explained, and not contradicted, that slavery was
not mentioned in the bills because the Missouri
Compromise controlled that matter. Yet it was
<!-- Image No 116 --><a name='Png116'></a><a name='Page094'></a><span class="pagenum">094</span>
well known that the Missouri Compromise was no
longer a sure barrier; for one wing of the pro-slavery
party asserted that it was unconstitutional
on the ground that slaves, being property, could
not be touched in the Territories by congressional
enactments; while another wing of the party preferred
the plausible cry of &quot;popular sovereignty,&quot;
than which no words could ring truer in American
ears; and no one doubted that, in order to give
that sovereignty full sway, they would at any convenient
moment vote to repeal even the &quot;sacred&quot;
Compromise. It could not be denied that this
was the better course, if it were practicable; and
accordingly, January 16, 1854, Senator Dixon of
Kentucky offered an amendment to the pending
Nebraska bill, which substantially embodied the
repeal. In the Senate Douglas was chairman of
the Committee on Territories, and was induced to
co&ouml;perate.<a name='FNanchor_63_63'></a><a href='#Footnote_63_63'><sup>[63]</sup></a>
 January 23, 1854, he introduced his
famous &quot;Kansas-Nebraska bill,&quot; establishing the
two Territories and declaring the Missouri Compromise
&quot;inoperative&quot; therein. A later amendment
declared the Compromise to be &quot;inconsistent
with the principle of non-intervention by Congress
with slavery in the States and Territories, as
recognized by the legislation of 1850,&quot; and therefore
&quot;inoperative and void; it being the true intent
and meaning of this Act not to legislate slavery
into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom,
<!-- Image No 117 --><a name='Png117'></a><a name='Page095'></a><span class="pagenum">095</span>
but to leave the people thereof perfectly free
to form and regulate their domestic institutions in
their own way, subject only to the Constitution.&quot;
After a long and hard fight the bill was passed
with this clause in it, which Benton well stigmatized
as a &quot;stump speech injected into the belly
of the bill.&quot; The insertion of the word State was
of momentous significance.</p>

<p>This repeal set the anti-slavery party all ablaze.
Among the rest Lincoln was fired with strenuous
indignation, and roused from the condition of
apparent indifference to public affairs in which he
had rested since the close of his term in Congress.
Douglas, coming home in the autumn, was so disagreeably
received by an angry audience in Chicago
that he felt it imperative to rehabilitate his stricken
popularity. This difficult task he essayed at the
great gathering of the State Fair in October.
But Lincoln was put forward to answer him, and
was brilliantly successful in doing so, if the highly
colored account of Mr. Herndon may be trusted.
Immediately after Lincoln's close, Owen Lovejoy,
the Abolitionist leader, announced &quot;a meeting in
the same place that evening of all the friends of
freedom.&quot; The scheme was to induce Lincoln to
address them, and thus publicly to commit him as
of their faith. But the astute Herndon, though
himself an Abolitionist, felt that for Lincoln personally
this was by no means desirable. So he
hastened to Lincoln and strenuously said: &quot;Go
home at once! Take Bob with you, and drive
<!-- Image No 118 --><a name='Png118'></a><a name='Page096'></a><span class="pagenum">096</span>
somewhere into the country, and stay till this thing
is over;&quot; and Lincoln did take Bob and drove
away to Tazewell Court House &quot;on business.&quot;
Herndon congratulates himself upon having &quot;saved
Lincoln,&quot; since either joining, or refusing to join,
the Abolitionists at that time would have been
attended with &quot;great danger.&quot; Lincoln had upon
his own part a wise instinct and a strong purpose
to keep hard by Douglas and to close with him as
often as opportunity offered. Soon afterward the
two encountered again, and on this occasion it is
narrated that Lincoln gave Douglas so much trouble
that Douglas cried for a truce, proposing that
neither of them should make any more speeches
that autumn, to which Lincoln good-naturedly
assented.</p>

<p>During this winter Lincoln was elected to the
state legislature, but contrary to his own wish.
For he designed to be a candidate for the United
States Senate, and there might be a question as
to his eligibility if he remained a member of the
electing body. Accordingly he resigned his seat,
which, to his surprise and chagrin, was immediately
filled by a Democrat; for there was a reaction
in Sangamon County. On February 8, 1855, the
legislature began voting to elect a senator. The
&quot;Douglas Democrats&quot; wished to reelect Shields,
the present incumbent. The first ballot stood,
Lincoln, 45, Shields, 41, Lyman Trumbull, 5,
scattering, 5 (or, according to other authority, 8).
After several ballots Shields was thrown over in
<!-- Image No 119 --><a name='Png119'></a><a name='Page097'></a><span class="pagenum">097</span>
favor of a more &quot;practicable&quot; candidate, Governor
Matteson, a &quot;quasi-independent,&quot; who, upon the
ninth ballot, showed a strength of 47, while Trumbull
had 35, Lincoln had run down to 15, and
&quot;scattering&quot; caught 1. Lincoln's weakness lay
in the fact that the Abolitionists had too loudly
praised him and publicly counted him as one of
themselves. For this reason five Democrats, disgusted
with Douglas for his attack on the Missouri
Compromise, but equally bitter against Abolitionism,
stubbornly refused ever to vote for a Whig,
above all a Whig smirched by Abolitionist applause.
So it seemed that Owen Lovejoy and his
friends had incumbered Lincoln with a fatal handicap.
The situation was this: Lincoln could count
upon his fifteen adherents to the extremity; but
the five anti-Douglas Democrats were equally
stanch against him, so that his chance was evidently
gone. Trumbull was a Democrat, but he
was opposed to the policy of Douglas's Kansas-Nebraska
bill; his following was not altogether
trustworthy, and a trifling defection from it seemed
likely to occur and to make out Matteson's majority.
Lincoln pondered briefly; then, subjecting
all else to the great principle of &quot;anti-Nebraska,&quot;
he urged his friends to transfer their votes to
Trumbull. With grumbling and reluctance they
did so, and by this aid, on the tenth ballot, Trumbull
was elected. In a letter to Washburne,
Lincoln wrote: &quot;I think you would have done
the same under the circumstances, though Judge
<!-- Image No 120 --><a name='Png120'></a><a name='Page098'></a><span class="pagenum">098</span>
Davis, who came down this morning, declares he
never would have consented to the 47 men being
controlled by the 5. I regret my defeat moderately,
but am not nervous about it.&quot; If that was
true which was afterwards so frequently reiterated
by Douglas during the campaign of 1858, that
a bargain had been struck between Lincoln and
Trumbull, whereby the former was to succeed
Shields and the latter was to succeed Douglas at
the election two years later, then Lincoln certainly
displayed on this occasion a &quot;generosity&quot; which
deserves more than the very moderate praise which
has been given it, of being &quot;above the range of
the mere politician's vision.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_64_64'></a><a href='#Footnote_64_64'><sup>[64]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>An immediate effect of this repealing legislation
of 1854 was to cast Kansas into the arena as booty
to be won in fight between anti-slavery and pro-slavery.
For this competition the North had the
advantage that its population outnumbered that of
the South in the ratio of three to two, and emigration
was in accord with the habits of the people.
Against this the South offset proximity, of which
the peculiar usefulness soon became apparent.
Then was quickly under way a fair fight, in a certain
sense, but most unfairly fought. Each side
contended after its fashion; Northern anti-slavery
merchants subscribed money to pay the expenses
of free-state immigrants. &quot;Border ruffians&quot; and
members of &quot;Blue Lodges&quot; and of kindred fraternities
came across the border from Missouri to
<!-- Image No 121 --><a name='Png121'></a>
<!-- Image No 122 --><a name='Png122'></a>
<!-- Image No 123 --><a name='Png123'></a><a name='Page099'></a><span class="pagenum">099</span>
take a hand in every politico-belligerent crisis.
The parties were not unequally matched; by temperament
the free-state men were inclined to orderly
and legitimate ways, yet they were willing
and able to fight fire with fire. On the other hand,
the slave-state men had a native preference for the
bowie-knife and the shot-gun, yet showed a kind
of respect for the ballot-box by insisting that it
should be stuffed with votes on their side. Thus
for a long while was waged a dubious, savage,
and peculiar warfare. Imprisonments and rescues,
beatings, shootings, plunderings, burnings, sieges,
and lootings of towns were interspersed with elections
of civil officers, with legislative enactments
in ordinary form, with trials, suits at law, legal
arguments, and decisions of judges. It is impossible
here to sketch in detail this strange phantasmagory
of arson, bloodshed, politics, and law.</p>

<p>Meantime other occurrences demand mention.
In May, 1854, the seizure in Boston of Anthony
Burns, as an escaped slave, caused a riot in which
the court-house was attacked by a mob, one of
the assailants was killed, and the militia were
called out. Other like seizures elsewhere aroused
the indignation of people who, whatever were their
abstract theories as to the law, revolted at the
actual spectacle of a man dragged back from
freedom into slavery. May 22, 1856, Preston S.
Brooks strode suddenly upon Charles Sumner,
seated and unarmed at his desk in the senate-chamber,
and beat him savagely over the head
<!-- Image No 124 --><a name='Png124'></a><a name='Page100'></a><span class="pagenum">100</span>
with a cane, inflicting very serious injuries. Had
it been a fair fight, or had the South repudiated
the act, the North might have made little of it, for
Sumner was too advanced in his views to be politically
popular. But, although the onslaught was
even more offensive for its cowardice than for
its brutality, nevertheless the South overwhelmed
Brooks with laudation, and by so doing made thousands
upon thousands of Republican votes at the
North. The deed, the enthusiastic greeting, and
the angry resentment marked the alarming height
to which the excitement had risen.</p>

<p>The presidential campaign of the following summer,
1856, showed a striking disintegration and
re-formation of political groups. Nominally there
were four parties in the field: Democrats, Whigs,
Native Americans or Know-Nothings, and Republicans.
The Know-Nothings had lately won some
state elections, but were of little account as a
national organization, for they stood upon an issue
hopelessly insignificant in comparison with slavery.
Already many had gone over to the Republican
camp; those who remained nominated as their candidates
Millard Fillmore and Andrew J. Donelson.
The Whigs were the feeble remnant of a really
dead party, held together by affection for the old
name; too few to do anything by themselves, they
took by adoption the Know-Nothing candidates.
The Republican party had been born only in 1854.
Its members, differing on other matters, united
upon the one doctrine, which they accepted as a
<!-- Image No 125 --><a name='Png125'></a><a name='Page101'></a><span class="pagenum">101</span>
test: opposition to the extension of slavery. They
nominated John C. Fremont and William L. Dayton,
and made a platform whereby they declared
it to be &quot;both the right and the duty of Congress
to prohibit in the Territories those twin relics of
barbarism, polygamy and slavery;&quot; by which vehement
and abusive language they excited the bitter
resentment of the Southern Democracy. In this
convention 110 votes were cast for Lincoln for
the second place on the ticket. Lamon tells the
little story that when this was told to Lincoln he
replied that he could not have been the person
designated, who was, doubtless, &quot;the great Lincoln
from Massachusetts.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_65_65'></a><a href='#Footnote_65_65'><sup>[65]</sup></a>
 In the Democratic party
there were two factions. The favorite candidate
of the South was Franklin Pierce, for re&euml;lection,
with Stephen A. Douglas as a substitute or second
choice; the North more generally preferred James
Buchanan, who was understood to be displeased
with the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. The
struggle was sharp, but was won by the friends of
Buchanan, with whom John C. Breckenridge was
coupled. The campaign was eager, for the Republicans
soon developed a strength beyond what had
been expected and which put the Democrats to
their best exertions. The result was</p>

Thus James Buchanan became President of the
United States, March 4, 1857,&mdash;stigmatized somewhat
too severely as &quot;a Northern man with Southern
principles;&quot; in fact an honest man and of good
abilities, who, in ordinary times, would have left a
fair reputation as a statesman of the second rank;
but a man hopelessly unfit alike in character and
in mind either to comprehend the present emergency
or to rise to its demands.<a name='FNanchor_66_66'></a><a href='#Footnote_66_66'><sup>[66]</sup></a>
 Yet, while the
Democrats triumphed, the Republicans enjoyed
the presage of the future; they had polled a total
number of votes which surprised every one; on
the other hand, the Democrats had lost ten States<a name='FNanchor_67_67'></a><a href='#Footnote_67_67'><sup>[67]</sup></a>

which they had carried in 1852 and had gained
only two others,<a name='FNanchor_68_68'></a><a href='#Footnote_68_68'><sup>[68]</sup></a>
 showing a net loss of eight
States; and their electoral votes had dwindled
from 254 to 174.</p>

<p>On the day following Buchanan's inauguration
that occurred which had been foreshadowed with
ill-advised plainness in his inaugural address. In
the famous case of Dred Scott,<a name='FNanchor_69_69'></a><a href='#Footnote_69_69'><sup>[69]</sup></a>
 the Supreme Court
of the United States established as law the doctrine
lately advanced by the Southern Democrats,
<!-- Image No 127 --><a name='Png127'></a><a name='Page103'></a><span class="pagenum">103</span>
that a slave was &quot;property,&quot; and that his owner
was entitled to be protected in the possession of
him, as such, in the Territories. This necessarily
demolished the rival theory of &quot;popular sovereignty,&quot;
which the Douglas Democrats had adopted,
not without shrewdness, as being far better suited
to the Northern mind. For clearly the people enjoyed
no sovereignty where they had no option.
Consequently in the Territories there was no longer
a slavery question. The indignation of anti-slavery
men of all shades of opinion was intense, and
was unfortunately justifiable. For wholly apart
from the controversy as to whether the law was
better expounded by the chief justice or by Judge
Curtis in his dissenting opinion, there remained
a main fact, undeniable and inexcusable, to wit:
that the court, having decided that the lower court
had no jurisdiction, and being therefore itself
unable to remand the cause for a new trial, had
then outstepped its own proper function and outraged
legal propriety by determining the questions
raised by the rest of the record,&mdash;questions which
no longer had any real standing before this tribunal.
This course was well known to have been
pursued with the purpose on the part of the majority
of the judges to settle by judicial authority,
and by a <i>dictum</i> conspicuously <i>obiter</i>, that great
slavery question with which Congress had grappled
in vain. It was a terrible blunder, for the people
were only incensed by a volunteered and unauthorized
interference. Moreover, the reasoning of
<!-- Image No 128 --><a name='Png128'></a><a name='Page104'></a><span class="pagenum">104</span>
Chief Justice Taney was such that the Republicans
began anxiously to inquire why it was not
as applicable to States as to Territories, and why
it must not be extended to States when occasion
should arrive; and in this connection it seemed
now apparent why &quot;States&quot; had been named in
the bill which repealed the Missouri Compromise.<a name='FNanchor_70_70'></a><a href='#Footnote_70_70'><sup>[70]</sup></a>

In spite of this menace the struggle in Kansas
was not slackened. Time had been counting heavily
in favor of the North. Her multitudinous
population ceaselessly fed the stream of immigrants,
and they were stubborn fellows who came
to stay, and therefore were sure to wear out the
persistence of the boot-and-saddle men from over
the Missouri border. Accordingly, in 1857, the
free-state men so vastly outnumbered the slavery
contingent, that even pro-slavery men had to acknowledge
it. Then the slavery party made its
last desperate effort. Toward the close of that
year the Lecompton Constitution was framed by
a convention chosen at an election in which the
free-state men, perhaps unwisely, had refused to
take part. When this pro-slavery instrument was
offered to the people, they were not allowed to
vote simply Yea or Nay, but only &quot;for the Constitution
with slavery,&quot; or &quot;for the Constitution
with no slavery.&quot; Again the free-state men refrained
from voting, and on December 21, 6,143
ballots were declared to have been cast &quot;for the
Constitution with slavery,&quot; and 589 &quot;for the Constitution
<!-- Image No 129 --><a name='Png129'></a><a name='Page105'></a><span class="pagenum">105</span>
with no slavery.&quot; Much more than one
third of the 6,143 were proved to be fraudulent, but
the residue far exceeded the requisite majority.
January 4, 1858, state officers were to be chosen,
and now the free-state men decided to make an
irregular opportunity to vote, in their turn, simply
for or against the Lecompton Constitution. This
time the pro-slavery men, considering the matter
already lawfully settled, refused to vote, and the
result was that this polling showed 10,226 against
the Constitution, 138 for the Constitution with
slavery, 24 for the Constitution without slavery.
It is an instance of Lincoln's political foresight
that nearly two years and a half before this condition
of affairs came about he had written: &quot;If
Kansas fairly votes herself a slave State, she must
be admitted, or the Union must be dissolved. But
how if she votes herself a slave State unfairly?... Must
she still be admitted, or the Union be
dissolved? That will be the phase of the question
when it first becomes a practical one.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_71_71'></a><a href='#Footnote_71_71'><sup>[71]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>The struggle was now transferred to Washington.
President Buchanan had solemnly pledged
himself to accept the result of the popular vote.
Now he was confronted by two popular votes, of
which the one made somewhat the better technical
and formal showing, and the other undeniably
expressed the true will of a large majority of lawful
voters. He selected the former, and advised
Congress to admit Kansas under the Lecompton
<!-- Image No 130 --><a name='Png130'></a><a name='Page106'></a><span class="pagenum">106</span>
Constitution with slavery. But Douglas took the
other side. The position of Douglas in the nation
and in the Democratic party deserves brief consideration,
for in a way it was the cause of Lincoln's
nomination as the Republican candidate for the
presidency in 1860. From 1852 to 1860 Douglas
was the most noteworthy man in public life in the
country. Webster, Clay, and Calhoun had passed
away. Seward, Chase, and Sumner, still in the
earlier stages of their brilliant careers, were organizing
the great party of the future. This
interval of eight years belonged to Douglas more
than to any other one man. He had been a candidate
for the Democratic nomination for the presidency
in 1852 and again in 1856; and had failed
to secure it in part by reason of that unwritten
rule whereby the leading statesmen are so often
passed over, in order to confer the great prize upon
insignificant and therefore presumably submissive
men. Douglas was not of this type; he had high
spirit, was ambitious, masterful, and self-confident;
he was also an aggressive, brilliant, and tireless
fighter in a political campaign, an orator combining
something of the impressiveness of Webster
with the readiness and roughness of the stump
speaker. He had a thorough familiarity with all
the politics, both the greater and the smaller, of
the time; he was shrewd and adroit as a politician,
and he had as good a right as any man then prominent
in public life to the more dignified title of
statesman. He had the art of popularity, and upon
<!-- Image No 131 --><a name='Png131'></a><a name='Page107'></a><span class="pagenum">107</span>
sufficient occasion could be supple and accommodating
even in the gravest matters of principle.
He had always been a Democrat. He now regarded
himself as properly the leader of the Democratic
party; and of course he still aimed at the
high office which he had twice missed.<a name='FNanchor_72_72'></a><a href='#Footnote_72_72'><sup>[72]</sup></a>
 With this
object in view, he had gone very far to retain his
hold upon the South. He told Southerners that
by his happy theory of &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; he
had educated the public mind, and accomplished
the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. When
the Dred Scott decision took the life out of his
&quot;popular sovereignty,&quot; he showed his wonted readiness
in adapting himself to the situation. To the
triumphant South he graciously admitted the finality
of a decision which sustained the most extreme
Southern doctrine. To the perturbed and indignant
North he said cheeringly that the decision
was of no practical consequence whatsoever! For
every one knew that slavery could not exist in
any community without the aid of friendly legislation;
and if any anti-slavery community should by
its anti-slavery legislature withhold this essential
friendly legislation, then slavery in that State
might be lawful but would be impossible. So, he
said, there is still in fact &quot;popular sovereignty.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_73_73'></a><a href='#Footnote_73_73'><sup>[73]</sup></a>

When the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution
<!-- Image No 132 --><a name='Png132'></a><a name='Page108'></a><span class="pagenum">108</span>
came up for consideration Douglas decided not to
rest content with the form of popular approval,
but to stand out for the substance. He quarreled
with Buchanan, and in an angry interview they exchanged
threats and defiance. Douglas felt himself
the greater man of the two in the party, and
audaciously indicated something like contempt for
the rival who was not leader but only President.
Conscience, if one may be allowed gravely to speak
of the conscience of a professional politician, and
policy were in comfortable unison in commending
this choice to Douglas. For his term as senator
was to expire in 1858, and re&euml;lection was not only
in itself desirable, but seemed essential to securing
the presidency in 1860. Heretofore Illinois had
been a Democratic State; the southern part, peopled
by immigrants from neighboring slave States,
was largely pro-slavery; but the northern part,
containing the rapidly growing city of Chicago,
had been filled from the East, and was inclined
to sympathize with the rest of the North. Such
being the situation, an avowal of Democratic principles,
coupled with the repudiation of the Lecompton
fraud, seemed the shrewd and safe course in
view of Douglas's political surroundings, also the
consistent, or may we say honest, course in view of
his antecedent position. If, in thus retaining his
hold on Illinois, he gave to the Southern Democracy
an offense which could never be forgotten or
forgiven, this misfortune was due to the impracticable
situation and not to any lack of skillful straegy
t<!-- Image No 133 --><a name='Png133'></a><a name='Page109'></a><span class="pagenum">109</span>
on his part. In spite of him the bill passed
the Senate, but in the House twenty-two Northern
Democrats went over to the opposition, and carried
a substitute measure, which established that
the Lecompton Constitution must again be submitted
to popular vote. Though this was done by
the body of which Douglas was not a member, yet
every one felt that it was in fact his triumph over
the administration. A Committee of Conference
then brought in the &quot;English bill.&quot; Under this
the Kansans were to vote, August 3, 1858, either
to accept the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution,
with the <i>douceur</i> of a land grant, or to reject it.
If they accepted it, the State was to be admitted
at once; if they rejected it, they were not to be
admitted until the population should reach the
number which was required for electing a member
to the House of Representatives. At present the
population was far short of this number, and therefore
rejection involved a long delay in acquiring
statehood. Douglas very justly assailed the unfairness
of a proposal by which an anti-slavery
vote was thus doubly and very severely handicapped;
but the bill was passed by both Houses
of Congress and was signed by the President. The
Kansans, however, by an enormous majority,<a name='FNanchor_74_74'></a><a href='#Footnote_74_74'><sup>[74]</sup></a>
 rejected
the bribes of land and statehood in connection
with slavery. For his action concerning the
<!-- Image No 134 --><a name='Png134'></a><a name='Page110'></a><span class="pagenum">110</span>
Lecompton Constitution and the &quot;English bill&quot;
Douglas afterward took much credit to himself.</p>

<p>Such was the stage of advancement of the slavery
conflict in the country, and such the position
of Douglas in national and in state politics, when
there took place that great campaign in Illinois
which made him again senator in 1858, and made
Lincoln President in 1860.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h2>THE LINCOLN-DOUGLAS JOINT DEBATE</h2>

<p>About this time Lincoln again became active in
the politics of his State, aiding in the formation of
the Republican party there. On May 29, 1856, a
state convention of &quot;all opponents of anti-Nebraska
legislation&quot; was held at Bloomington. After &quot;a
platform ringing with strong anti-Nebraska sentiments&quot;
had been adopted, Lincoln, &quot;in response
to repeated calls, came forward and delivered a
speech of such earnestness and power that no one
who heard it will ever forget the effect it produced.&quot;
It was &quot;never written out or printed,&quot;
which is to be regretted; but it lives in one of
those vivid descriptions by Herndon which leave
nothing to the imagination. For the moment this
triumph was gratifying; but when Lincoln, leaving
the hot enthusiasts of Bloomington, came home to
his fellow townsmen at Springfield, he passed into
a chill atmosphere of indifference and disapproval.
An effort was made to gather a mass meeting in
order to ratify the action of the state convention.
But the &quot;mass&quot; consisted of three persons, viz.,
Abraham Lincoln, Herndon, and one John Pain.
It was trying, but Lincoln was finely equal to the
<!-- Image No 136 --><a name='Png136'></a><a name='Page112'></a><span class="pagenum">112</span>
occasion; in a few words, passing from jest to
earnest, he said that the meeting was larger than
he <i>knew</i> it would be; for while he knew that he
and his partner would attend, he was not sure of
any one else; and yet another man had been found
brave enough to come out. But, &quot;while all seems
dead, the age itself is not. It liveth as sure as our
Maker liveth. Under all this seeming want of
life and motion the world does move, nevertheless.
Be hopeful, and now let us adjourn and appeal to
the people!&quot;</p>

<p>In the presidential campaign of 1856 the Republicans
of Illinois put Lincoln on their electoral
ticket, and he entered into the campaign promptly
and very zealously. Traveling untiringly to and
fro, he made about fifty speeches. By the quality
of these, even more than by their number, he became
the champion of the party, so that pressing
demands for him came from the neighboring
States. He was even heard of in the East. But
there he encountered a lack of appreciation and
in some quarters an hostility which he felt to be
hurtful to his prospects as well as unjust towards
a leading Republican of the Northwest. Horace
Greeley, enthusiastic, well meaning, ever blundering,
the editor of the New York &quot;Tribune,&quot; cast
the powerful influence of that sheet against him;
and as the senatorial contest of 1858 was approaching,
in which Lincoln hoped to be a principal, this
ill feeling was very unfortunate.<a name='FNanchor_75_75'></a><a href='#Footnote_75_75'><sup>[75]</sup></a>
 &quot;I fear,&quot; he
<!-- Image No 137 --><a name='Png137'></a><a name='Page113'></a><span class="pagenum">113</span>
said, &quot;that Greeley's attitude will damage me
with Sumner, Seward, Wilson, Phillips, and other
friends in the East,&quot;&mdash;and by the way, it is interesting
to note this significant list of political
&quot;friends.&quot; Thereupon Herndon, as guardian of
Lincoln's political prospects, went to pass the opening
months of the important year upon a crusade
among the great men of the East, designing to
extinguish the false lights erroneously hung out
by persons ignorant of the truth. Erelong he
cheered Lincoln by encouraging accounts of success,
and of kind words spoken by many Eastern
magnates.</p>

<p>In 1858, ability, courage, activity, ambition, the
prestige of success, and a plausible moderation in
party politics combined to make Douglas the most
conspicuous individual in the public view. There
was no other way whereby any other man could so
surely attract the close and interested attention of
the whole people as by meeting Douglas in direct
personal competition. If Douglas had not held
the position which he did, or if, holding it, he had
lived in another State than Illinois, Lincoln might
never have been President of the United States.
But the essential facts lay favorably for effecting
that presentation before the people which was indispensable
for his fortunes. In April, 1858, the
<!-- Image No 138 --><a name='Png138'></a><a name='Page114'></a><span class="pagenum">114</span>
Democratic State Convention of Illinois indorsed
the position which Douglas had taken in the Kansas
business. This involved that the party should
present him as its candidate for re&euml;lection to the
national Senate by the legislature whose members
were to be chosen in the following autumn. &quot;In
the very nature of things,&quot; says the enthusiastic
Herndon, Lincoln was at once selected by the
Republicans, and on June 16 their convention
resolved that &quot;Hon. Abraham Lincoln is our first
and only choice for United States senator to fill the
vacancy about to be created by the expiration of
Mr. Douglas's term of office.&quot; Immediately the
popular excitement gave measure of the estimate
placed upon the two men by those who most accurately
knew their qualities. All Illinoisians looked
forward eagerly to the fine spectacle of a battle
royal between real leaders.</p>

<p>The general political condition was extremely
confused. The great number of worthy citizens,
who had been wont to save themselves from the
worry of critical thought in political matters by
the simple process of uniform allegiance to a party,
now found the old familiar organizations rapidly
disintegrating. They were dismayed and bewildered
at the scene; everywhere there were new
cries, new standards, new leaders, while small
bodies of recruits, displaying in strange union old
comrades beside old foes, were crossing to and
fro and changing relationships, to the inextricable
confusion of the situation. In such a chaos each
<!-- Image No 139 --><a name='Png139'></a><a name='Page115'></a><span class="pagenum">115</span>
man was driven to do his own thinking, to discover
his genuine beliefs, and to determine in what company
he could stand enduringly in the troublous
times ahead. It was one of those periods in which
small men are laid aside and great leaders are
recognized by popular instinct; when the little
band that is in deepest earnest becomes endowed
with a force which compels the mass of careless,
temporizing human-kind to gravitate towards it.
Such bands were now the Abolitionists at the
North and the Secessionists at the South. Between
them lay the nation, disquieted, contentious,
and more than a little angry at the prevalent discomfort
and alarm. At the North nine men out
of ten cared far less for any principle, moral or
political, than they did for the discovery of some
course whereby this unwelcome conflict between
slavery and freedom could be prevented from disorganizing
the course of daily life and business;
and since the Abolitionists were generally charged
with being in great measure responsible for the
present menacing condition, they were regarded
with bitter animosity by a large number of their
fellow citizens. The Secessionists were not in
equal disfavor at the South, yet they were still
very much in the minority, even in the Gulf
States.</p>

<p>Illinois had been pretty stanchly Democratic in
times past, but no one could forecast the complexion
which she would put on in the coming campaign.
The Whigs were gone. The Republican
<!-- Image No 140 --><a name='Png140'></a><a name='Page116'></a><span class="pagenum">116</span>
party, though so lately born, yet had already traversed
the period of infancy and perhaps also that
of youth; men guessed wildly how many voters
would now cast its ballot. On the other hand, the
Democrats were suffering from internal quarrels.
The friends of Douglas, and all moderate Democrats,
declared him to be the leader of the Democracy;
but Southern conventions and newspapers
were angrily &quot;reading him out&quot; of the party, and
the singular spectacle was witnessed of the Democratic
administration sending out its orders to all
Federal office-holders in Illinois to oppose the
Democratic nominee, even to the point of giving
the election to the Republicans; for if discipline
was to exist, a defection like that of which Douglas
had been guilty must be punished with utter and
everlasting destruction at any cost. This schism
of course made the numerical uncertainties even
more uncertain than they rightfully should have
been. Yet, in an odd way, the same fact worked
also against Lincoln; for Douglas's recent votes
against the pro-slavery measures of the administration
for the admission of Kansas, together with his
own direct statements on recent occasions, had put
him in a light which misled many Northern anti-slavery
men, whose perception did not penetrate
to the core-truth. For example, not only Greeley,
but Henry Wilson, Burlingame, Washburne, Colfax,
and more, really believed that Douglas was
turning his back upon his whole past career, and
that this brilliant political strategist was actually
<!-- Image No 141 --><a name='Png141'></a><a name='Page117'></a><span class="pagenum">117</span>
bringing into the anti-slavery camp<a name='FNanchor_76_76'></a><a href='#Footnote_76_76'><sup>[76]</sup></a>
 all his accumulations
of prestige, popularity, and experience,
all his seductive eloquence, his skill, and his grand
mastery over men. Blinded by the dazzling prospect,
they gave all their influence in favor of this
priceless recruit, forgetting that, if he were in fact
such an apostate as they believed him to be, he
would come to them terribly shrunken in value and
trustworthiness. Some even were so infatuated as
to insist that the Republicans of Illinois ought
to present no candidate against him. Fortunately
the Illinoisians knew their fellow citizen better;
yet in so strange a jumble no one could deny that
it was a doubtful conflict in which these two rivals
were joining.</p>

<p>Lincoln had expected to be nominated, and during
several weeks he had been thinking over his
speech of acceptance. However otherwise he might
seem at any time to be engaged, he was ceaselessly
turning over this matter in his mind; and frequently
he stopped short to jot down an idea or
expression upon some scrap of paper, which then
he thrust into his hat. Thus, piece by piece, the
accumulation grew alike inside and outside of his
head, and at last he took all his fragments and
with infinite consideration moulded them into
<!-- Image No 142 --><a name='Png142'></a><a name='Page118'></a><span class="pagenum">118</span>
unity. So studiously had he wrought that by the
time of delivery he had unconsciously committed
the whole speech accurately to memory. If so
much painstaking seemed to indicate an exaggerated
notion of the importance of his words, he was
soon vindicated by events; for what he said was
subjected to a dissection and a criticism such as
have not often pursued the winged words of the
orator. When at last the composition was completed,
he gathered a small coterie of his friends
and admirers, and read it to them. The opening
paragraph was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;If we could first know where we are, and
whither we are tending, we could better judge
what to do and how to do it. We are now far
into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with
the avowed object and confident promise of putting
an end to slavery agitation. Under the operation
of that policy, that agitation has not only not
ceased, but has constantly augmented. In my
opinion, it will not cease until a crisis shall have
been reached and passed. 'A house divided against
itself cannot stand.' I believe this government
cannot endure permanently half slave and half
free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved,&mdash;I
do not expect the house to fall,&mdash;but I do
expect it will cease to be divided. It will become
all one thing or all the other. Either the opponents
of slavery will arrest the further spread of
it, and place it where the public mind shall rest
in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate
<!-- Image No 143 --><a name='Png143'></a><a name='Page119'></a><span class="pagenum">119</span>
extinction; or its advocates will push it forward,
till it shall become alike lawful in all the States,
old as well as new,&mdash;North as well as South.&quot;</p>

<p>As the reader watched for the effect of this
exordium he only saw disapproval and consternation.
His assembled advisers and critics, each and
all save only the fiery Herndon, protested that
language so daring and advanced would work a
ruin that might not be mended in years. Lincoln
heard their condemnation with gravity rather than
surprise. But he had worked his way to a conviction,
and he was immovable; all he said was, that
the statement was true, right, and just, that it was
time it should be made, and that he would make it,
even though he might have &quot;to go down with it;&quot;
that he would &quot;rather be defeated with this expression
in the speech ... than to be victorious without
it.&quot; Accordingly, on the next day he spoke
the paragraph without the change of a word.</p>

<p>It is not without effort that we can now appreciate
fully why this utterance was so momentous in
the spring of 1858.<a name='FNanchor_77_77'></a><a href='#Footnote_77_77'><sup>[77]</sup></a>
 By it Lincoln came before
the people with a plain statement of precisely that
<!-- Image No 144 --><a name='Png144'></a><a name='Page120'></a><span class="pagenum">120</span>
which more than nine hundred and ninety-nine
persons in every thousand, especially at the North,
were striving with all their might to stamp down
as an untruth; he said to them what they all were
denying with desperation, and with rage against
the asserters. Their bitterness was the greater
because very many, in the bottom of their hearts,
distrusted their own painful and strenuous denial.
No words could be more unpopular than that the
divided house could not permanently stand, when
the whole nation was insisting, with the intensity
of despair, that it could stand, would stand, must
stand. Consequently occurrences soon showed his
friends to be right so far as concerned the near,
practical point: that the paragraph would cost
more voters in Illinois than Lincoln could lose without
losing his election. But beyond that point,
a little farther away in time, much deeper down
amid enduring results, Lincoln's judgment was
ultimately seen to rest upon fundamental wisdom,
politically as well as morally. For Lincoln was
no idealist, sacrificing realities to abstractions; on
the contrary, the right which he saw was always a
practical right, a right which could be compassed.
In this instance, the story goes that he retorted
upon some of those who grumbled about his &quot;mistake,&quot;
that in time they &quot;would consider it the
wisest thing he ever said.&quot; In this he foretold
truly; that daring and strong utterance was the
first link in the chain of which a more distant link
lay across the threshold of the White House.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 145 --><a name='Png145'></a><a name='Page121'></a><span class="pagenum">121</span>
A battle opened by so resounding a shot was
sure to be furious. Writers and speakers fell
upon the fateful paragraph and tore it savagely.
They found in it a stimulus which, in fact, was not
needed; for already were present all the elements
of the fiercest struggle,&mdash;the best man and the
best fighter in each party at the front, and not
unevenly matched; a canvass most close and doubtful;
and a question which stirred the souls of men
with the passions of crusading days. Douglas
added experience and distinction to gallantry in
attack, adroitness in defense, readiness in personalities,
and natural aptitude for popular oratory.
Lincoln frankly admitted his formidable qualifications.
But the Republican managers had a shrewd
appreciation of both opponents; they saw that
Lincoln's forte lay in hitting out straight, direct,
and hard; and they felt that blows of the kind he
delivered should not go out into the air, but should
alight upon a concrete object,&mdash;upon Douglas.
They conceived a wise plan. On July 24, 1858,
Lincoln challenged Douglas to a series of joint
debates. Douglas accepted, and named seven meetings,
which he so arranged that he opened and
closed four times and Lincoln opened and closed
three times; but Lincoln made no point of the inequality;
the arrangement was completed, and this
famous duel constituted another link in that White
House chain.</p>

<p>The setting of the spectacle had the picturesqueness
of the times and the region. The people
<!-- Image No 146 --><a name='Png146'></a><a name='Page122'></a><span class="pagenum">122</span>
gathered in vast multitudes, to the number of ten
thousand, even of twenty thousand, at the places
named for the speech-making; they came in their
wagons from all the country round, bringing provisions,
and making camps in the groves and
fields. There were bonfires and music, parading
and drinking. He was a singular man in Illinois
who was not present at some one of these encounters.</p>

<p>Into a competition so momentous Lincoln entered
with a full appreciation of the burden and
responsibility which it put upon him. He had at
once to meet a false gloss of his famous sentence;
and though he had been very precise and accurate
in his phraseology for the express purpose of
escaping misinterpretation, yet it would have been
a marvel in applied political morals if the paraphrases
devised by Douglas had been strictly ingenuous.
The favorite distortion was to alter what
was strictly a forecast into a declaration of a
policy, to make a prediction pass for an avowal of
a purpose to wage war against slavery until either
the &quot;institution&quot; or &quot;Abolitionism&quot; should be
utterly defeated and forever exterminated. It was
said to be a &quot;doctrine&quot; which was &quot;revolutionary
and destructive of this government,&quot; and which
&quot;invited a warfare between the North and the
South, to be carried on with ruthless vengeance,
until the one section or the other shall be driven
to the wall and become the victim of the rapacity
of the other.&quot; Such misrepresentation annoyed
<!-- Image No 147 --><a name='Png147'></a><a name='Page123'></a><span class="pagenum">123</span>
Lincoln all the more because it was undeserved.
The history of the utterance thus maltreated illustrates
the deliberate, cautious, thorough way in
which his mind worked. So long ago as August
15, 1855, he had closed a letter with the paragraph:
&quot;Our political problem now is: Can we,
as a nation, continue together <i>permanently</i>&mdash;<i>forever</i>,
half slave and half free? The problem is
too mighty for me. May God in his mercy superintend
the solution.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_78_78'></a><a href='#Footnote_78_78'><sup>[78]</sup></a>
 This is one among many
instances which show how studiously Lincoln pondered
until he had got his conclusion into that
simple shape in which it was immutable. When
he had found a form which satisfied him for the
expression of a conviction, he was apt to use it
repeatedly rather than to seek new and varied
shapes, so that substantially identical sentences
often recur at distant intervals of time and place.</p>

<p>When one has been long studying with much
earnest intensity of thought a perplexing and moving
question, and at last frames a conclusion with
painstaking precision in perfectly clear language,
it is not pleasant to have that accurate utterance
misstated with tireless reiteration, and with infinite
art and plausibility. But for this vexation
Lincoln could find no remedy, and it was in vain
that he again and again called attention to the fact
that he had expressed neither a &quot;doctrine,&quot; nor an
&quot;invitation,&quot; nor any &quot;purpose&quot; or policy whatsoever.
<!-- Image No 148 --><a name='Png148'></a><a name='Page124'></a><span class="pagenum">124</span>
But as it seemed not altogether courageous
to leave his position in doubt, he said: &quot;Now, it
is singular enough, if you will carefully read that
passage over, that I did not say in it that I was in
favor of anything. I only said what I expected
would take place.... I did not even say that
I desired that slavery should be put in course of
ultimate extinction. I do say so now, however, so
there need be no longer any difficulty about that.&quot;
He felt that nothing short of such extinction would
surely prevent the revival of a dispute which had
so often been settled &quot;<i>forever</i>.&quot; &quot;We can no more
foretell,&quot; he said, &quot;where the end of this slavery
agitation will be than we can see the end of the
world itself.... There is no way of putting an
end to the slavery agitation amongst us but to put
it back upon the basis where our fathers placed it....
Then the public mind will rest in the belief
that it is in the course of ultimate extinction.&quot;</p>

<p>There was much of this eloquence about &quot;the
fathers,&quot; much evocation of the shades of the
great departed, who, having reached the eternal
silence, could be claimed by both sides. The contention
was none the less strenuous because it was
entirely irrelevant; since the opinion of &quot;the fathers&quot;
could not make slavery right or wrong.
Many times therefore did Douglas charge Lincoln
with having said &quot;that the Union could not endure
divided as our fathers made it, with free and
slave States;&quot; as though this were a sort of blasphemy
against the national demigods. Lincoln
<!-- Image No 149 --><a name='Png149'></a><a name='Page125'></a><span class="pagenum">125</span>
aptly retorted that, as matter of fact, these same
distinguished &quot;fathers&quot;&mdash;&quot;Washington, Jefferson,
Franklin, Madison, Hamilton, Jay, and the
great men of that day&quot;&mdash;did not <i>make</i>, but <i>found</i>,
the nation half slave and half free; that they set
&quot;many clear marks of disapprobation&quot; upon slavery,
and left it so situated that the popular mind
rested in the belief that it was in the course of
ultimate extinction. Unfortunately it had not
been allowed to remain as they had left it; but on
the contrary, &quot;all the trouble and convulsion has
proceeded from the efforts to spread it over more
territory.&quot;</p>

<p>Pursuing this line, Lincoln alleged the purpose
of the pro-slavery men to make slavery &quot;perpetual
and universal&quot; and &quot;national.&quot; In his great
speech of acceptance at Springfield he put this
point so well that he never improved upon this
first presentation of it. The repeal of the Missouri
Compromise in 1854 &quot;opened all the national
territory to slavery, and was the first point
gained. But so far Congress only had acted, and
an indorsement by the people, real or imaginary,&quot;
was obtained by &quot;the notable argument of 'squatter
sovereignty,' otherwise called 'sacred right of
self-government,' which latter phrase, though expressive
of the only rightful basis of any government,
was so perverted in this attempted use of it
as to amount to just this: that if any <i>one</i> man
choose to enslave <i>another</i>, no <i>third</i> man shall be
permitted to object. That argument was incorporated
<!-- Image No 150 --><a name='Png150'></a><a name='Page126'></a><span class="pagenum">126</span>
into the Nebraska bill.&quot; In May, 1854,
this bill was passed. Then the presidential election
came. &quot;Mr. Buchanan was elected, and the
indorsement was secured. That was the second
point gained.&quot; Meantime the celebrated case of
the negro, Dred Scott, was pending in the Supreme
Court, and the &quot;President in his inaugural
address fervently exhorted the people to abide by
the forthcoming decision, whatever it might be.
Then in a few days came the decision,&quot; which was
at once emphatically indorsed by Douglas, &quot;the
reputed author of the Nebraska bill,&quot; and by the
new President.</p>

<p>&quot;At length a squabble springs up between the
President and the author of the Nebraska bill on
the mere question of <i>fact</i>, whether the Lecompton
Constitution was or was not, in any just sense,
made by the people of Kansas; and in that quarrel
the latter declares that all he wants is a fair
vote for the people, and that he cares not whether
slavery be voted <i>down</i> or voted <i>up</i>.</p>

<p>... &quot;The several points of the Dred Scott decision
in connection with Senator Douglas's 'care not'
policy constitute the piece of machinery in its
present state of advancement. This was the third
point gained.</p>

<p>... &quot;We cannot absolutely know that all these exact
adaptations are the result of preconcert. But
when we see a lot of framed timbers, different
<!-- Image No 151 --><a name='Png151'></a><a name='Page127'></a><span class="pagenum">127</span>
portions of which we know have been gotten out at
different times and places and by different workmen,
&mdash;Stephen, Franklin, Roger, and James, for
instance,&mdash;and when we see these timbers joined
together, and see they exactly make the frame of
a house or a mill, all the tenons and mortices
exactly fitting, and all the lengths and proportions
of the different pieces exactly adapted to their
respective places, and not a piece too many or too
few,&mdash;not omitting even scaffolding; or, if a single
piece be lacking, we see the place in the frame
exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring such piece
in,&mdash;in such a case, we find it impossible not to
believe that Stephen and Franklin and Roger and
James all understood one another from the beginning,
and all worked upon a common plan or draft
drawn up before the first blow was struck.</p>

<p>&quot;It should not be overlooked that by the Nebraska
bill the people of a <i>State</i> as well as a Territory
were to be left 'perfectly free,' 'subject only
to the Constitution.' Why mention a <i>State</i>?...
Why is mention of this lugged into this merely
territorial law?</p>

<p>... &quot;Put this and that together, and we have
another nice little niche, which we may erelong see
filled with another Supreme Court decision, declaring
that the Constitution of the United States
does not permit a <i>State</i> to exclude slavery from
its limits. And this may especially be expected if
the doctrine of 'care not whether slavery be voted
<!-- Image No 152 --><a name='Png152'></a><a name='Page128'></a><span class="pagenum">128</span>
down or voted up' shall gain upon the public mind
sufficiently to give promise that such a decision can
be maintained when made. Such a decision is all
that slavery now lacks of being alike lawful in
all the States.&quot; Following out this idea, Lincoln
repeatedly put to Douglas a question to which he
could never get a direct answer from his nimble
antagonist: &quot;If a decision is made, holding that
the people of the <i>States</i> cannot exclude slavery,
will he support it, or not?&quot;</p>

<p>Even so skillful a dialectician as Douglas found
this compact structure of history and argument a
serious matter. Its simple solidity was not so susceptible
to treatment by the perverting process as
had been the figurative and prophetic utterance
about the &quot;house divided against itself.&quot; Neither
could he find a chink between the facts and the
inferences. One aspect of the speech, however,
could not be passed over. Lincoln said that he
had not charged &quot;Stephen and Franklin and
Roger and James&quot; with collusion and conspiracy;
but he admitted that he had &quot;arrayed the evidence
tending to prove,&quot; and which he &quot;thought did
prove,&quot; these things.<a name='FNanchor_79_79'></a><a href='#Footnote_79_79'><sup>[79]</sup></a>
 It was impossible for the
four distinguished gentlemen<a name='FNanchor_80_80'></a><a href='#Footnote_80_80'><sup>[80]</sup></a>
 who owned the rest
<!-- Image No 153 --><a name='Png153'></a><a name='Page129'></a><span class="pagenum">129</span>
of these names to refuse to plead. Accordingly
Douglas sneered vehemently at the idea that two
presidents, the chief justice, and he himself had
been concerned in that grave crime against the
State which was imputed to them; and when, by
his lofty indignation, he had brought his auditors
into sympathy, he made the only possible reply:
that the real meaning, the ultimate logical outcome,
of what Lincoln had said was, that a decision
of the Supreme Court was to be set aside by the
political action of the people at the polls. The
Supreme Court had interpreted the Constitution,
and Lincoln was inciting the people to annul that
interpretation by some political process not known
to the law. For himself, he proclaimed with effective
emphasis his allegiance to that great tribunal
in the performance of its constitutional duties.
Lincoln replied that he also bowed to the Dred
Scott decision in the specific case; but he repudiated
it as a binding rule in political action.<a name='FNanchor_81_81'></a><a href='#Footnote_81_81'><sup>[81]</sup></a>
 His
point seemed more obscure than was usual with
<!-- Image No 154 --><a name='Png154'></a><a name='Page130'></a><span class="pagenum">130</span>
him, and not satisfactory as an answer to Douglas.
But as matter of fact no one was deceived by the
amusing adage of the profession: that the courts
do not <i>make</i> the law, but only <i>declare what it is</i>.
Every one knew that the law was just what the
judges chose from time to time to say that it was,
and that if judicial <i>declarations</i> of the law were
not reversed quite so often as legislative <i>makings</i>
of the law were repealed, it was only because the
identity of a bench is usually of longer duration
than the identity of a legislative body. If the
people, politically, willed the reversal of the Dred
Scott decision, it was sure in time to be judicially
reversed.<a name='FNanchor_82_82'></a><a href='#Footnote_82_82'><sup>[82]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>Douglas boasted that the Democrats were a
national party, whereas the &quot;Black Republicans&quot;
were a sectional body whose creed could not be
uttered south of Mason and Dixon's line. He was
assiduous in fastening upon Lincoln the name of
&quot;Abolitionist,&quot; and &quot;Black Republican,&quot; epithets
so unpopular that those who held the faith often
denied the title, and he only modified them by the
offensive admission that Lincoln's doctrines were
sometimes disingenuously weakened to suit certain
audiences: &quot;His principles in the north [of Illinois]
are jet black; in the centre they are in color
a decent mulatto; and in lower Egypt<a name='FNanchor_83_83'></a><a href='#Footnote_83_83'><sup>[83]</sup></a>
 they are
almost white.&quot;</p>

<p><!-- Image No 155 --><a name='Png155'></a><a name='Page131'></a><span class="pagenum">131</span>
Concerning sectionalism, Lincoln countered
fairly enough on his opponent by asking: Was
it, then, the case that it was slavery which was
national, and freedom which was sectional? Or,
&quot;Is it the true test of the soundness of a doctrine
that in some places people won't let you proclaim
it?&quot; But the remainder of Douglas's assault was
by no means to be disposed of by quick retort.
When Lincoln was pushed to formulate accurately
his views concerning the proper status of the negro
in the community, he had need of all his extraordinary
care in statement. Herein lay problems that
were vexing many honest citizens and clever men
besides himself, and were breeding much disagreement
among persons who all were anti-slavery in
a general way, but could by no means reach a comfortable
unison concerning troublesome particulars.
The &quot;all men free and equal&quot; of the Constitution,
and the talk about human brotherhood, gave
the Democrats wide scope for harassing anti-slavery
men with vexatious taunts and embarrassing
cross-interrogatories on practical points. &quot;I
do not question,&quot; said Douglas, &quot;Mr. Lincoln's
conscientious belief that the negro was made his
equal, and hence is his brother. But for my own
part, I do not regard the negro as my equal, and
positively deny that he is my brother, or any kin
to me whatever.&quot; He said that &quot;the signers of
the Declaration had no reference to the negro,...
or any other inferior and degraded race, when they
spoke of the equality of men,&quot; but meant only
&quot;white men, of European birth and descent.&quot;
<!-- Image No 156 --><a name='Png156'></a><a name='Page132'></a><span class="pagenum">132</span>
This topic opens the whole subject of Lincoln's
political affiliations and of his opinions concerning
slavery and the negro, opinions which seem to have
undergone no substantial change during the interval
betwixt this campaign and his election to the
presidency. Some selections from what he said
may sufficiently explain his position.</p>

<p>At Freeport, August 27, replying to a series of
questions from Douglas, he declared that he had
supposed himself, &quot;since the organization of the
Republican party at Bloomington, in May, 1856,
bound as a party man by the platforms of the
party, then and since.&quot; He said: &quot;I do not now,
nor ever did, stand in favor of the unconditional
repeal of the Fugitive Slave Law.&quot; He believed
that under the Constitution the Southerners were
entitled to such a law; but thought that the existing
law &quot;should have been framed so as to be
free from some of the objections that pertain to it,
without lessening its efficiency.&quot; He would not
&quot;introduce it as a new subject of agitation upon
the general question of slavery.&quot;</p>

<p>He should be &quot;exceedingly sorry&quot; ever to have
to pass upon the question of admitting more slave
States into the Union, and exceedingly glad to
know that another never would be admitted. But
&quot;if slavery shall be kept out of the Territories
during the territorial existence of any one given
Territory, and then the people shall, having a fair
chance and a clear field, when they come to adopt
<!-- Image No 157 --><a name='Png157'></a><a name='Page133'></a><span class="pagenum">133</span>
their constitution, do such an extraordinary thing
as to adopt a slave constitution, uninfluenced by
the actual presence of the institution among them,
I see no alternative, if we own the country, but to
admit them into the Union.&quot; He should also, he
said, be &quot;exceedingly glad to see slavery abolished
in the District of Columbia,&quot; and he believed that
Congress had &quot;constitutional power to abolish it&quot;
there; but he would favor the measure only upon
condition: &quot;First, that the abolition should be
gradual; second, that it should be on a vote of
the majority of qualified voters in the District;
and, third, that compensation should be made to
unwilling owners.&quot; As to the abolition of the
slave trade between the different States, he acknowledged
that he had not considered the matter
sufficiently to have reached a conclusion concerning
it. But if he should think that Congress had
power to effect such abolition, he should &quot;not be
in favor of the exercise of that power unless upon
some conservative principle, akin to what I have
said in relation to the abolition of slavery in the
District of Columbia.&quot; As to the territorial controversy,
he said: &quot;I am impliedly, if not expressly,
pledged to a belief in the <i>right</i> and <i>duty</i>
of Congress to prohibit slavery in all the United
States Territories.&quot; Concerning the acquisition of
new territory he said: &quot;I am not generally opposed
to honest acquisition of territory; and in
any given case I would or would not oppose such
acquisition, according as I might think such acquisition
<!-- Image No 158 --><a name='Png158'></a><a name='Page134'></a><span class="pagenum">134</span>
would or would not aggravate the slavery
question among ourselves.&quot; The statement derived
its immediate importance from the well-known
purpose of the administration and a considerable
party in the South very soon to acquire
Cuba. All these utterances were certainly clear
enough, and were far from constituting Abolitionist
doctrine, though they were addressed to
an audience &quot;as strongly tending to Abolitionism
as any audience in the State of Illinois,&quot; and Mr.
Lincoln believed that he was saying &quot;that which,
if it would be offensive to any person and render
them enemies to himself, would be offensive to
persons in this audience.&quot;</p>

<p>At Quincy Lincoln gave his views concerning
Republicanism with his usual unmistakable accuracy,
and certainly he again differentiated it widely
from Abolitionism. The Republican party, he
said, think slavery &quot;a moral, a social, and a political
wrong.&quot; Any man who does not hold this
opinion &quot;is misplaced and ought to leave us.
While, on the other hand, if there be any man
in the Republican party who is impatient over the
necessity springing from its actual presence, and is
impatient of the constitutional guarantees thrown
around it, and would act in disregard of these,
he, too, is misplaced, standing with us. He will
find his place somewhere else; for we have a due
regard ... for all these things.&quot; ... &quot;I have
always hated slavery as much as any Abolitionist,...
but I have always been quiet about it until
<!-- Image No 159 --><a name='Png159'></a><a name='Page135'></a><span class="pagenum">135</span>
this new era of the introduction of the Nebraska
bill again.&quot; He repeated often that he had &quot;no
purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with
the institution of slavery in the States where it
exists;&quot; that he had &quot;no lawful right to do so,&quot;
and &quot;no inclination to do so.&quot; He said that his
declarations as to the right of the negro to &quot;life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot; were designed
only to refer to legislation &quot;about any new
country which is not already cursed with the actual
presence of the evil,&mdash;slavery.&quot; He denied having
ever &quot;manifested any impatience with the
necessities that spring from the ... actual existence
of slavery among us, where it does already
exist.&quot;</p>

<p>He dwelt much upon the equality clause of the
Declaration. If we begin &quot;making exceptions to
it, where will it stop? If one man says it does
not mean a negro, why not another say it does not
mean some other man?&quot; Only within three years
past had any one doubted that negroes were included
by this language. But he said that, while
the authors &quot;intended to include <i>all</i> men, they did
not mean to declare all men equal <i>in all respects</i>,...
in color, size, intellect, moral development, or
social capacity,&quot; but only &quot;equal in certain inalienable
rights.&quot; &quot;Anything that argues me into
his [Douglas's] idea of perfect social and political
equality with the negro is but a specious and
fantastic arrangement of words, by which a man
can prove a horse chestnut to be a chestnut horse....
<!-- Image No 160 --><a name='Png160'></a><a name='Page136'></a><span class="pagenum">136</span>
I have no purpose to produce political and
social equality between the white and the black
races. There is a physical difference between the
two, which, in my judgment, will probably forever
forbid their living together upon the footing of
perfect equality; and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity
that there must be a difference, I, as well as
Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which
I belong having the superior position.... But
I hold that ... there is no reason in the world
why the negro is not entitled to all the natural
rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence,
the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness. I hold that he is as much entitled
to these as the white man. I agree with Judge
Douglas that he is not my equal in many respects,
&mdash;certainly not in color, perhaps not in moral or
intellectual endowment. But in the right to eat
the bread, without the leave of anybody else, which
his own hand earns, <i>he is my equal, and the equal
of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living
man</i>.&quot; Later at Charleston he reiterated much of
this in almost identical language, and then in his
turn took his fling at Douglas: &quot;I am not in favor
of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of
qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry
with white people.... I do not understand that
because I do not want a negro woman for a slave
I must necessarily want her for a wife. My understanding
is that I can just let her alone.... I
have never had the least apprehension that I or
<!-- Image No 161 --><a name='Png161'></a><a name='Page137'></a><span class="pagenum">137</span>
my friends would marry negroes, if there was no
law to keep them from it; but as Judge Douglas
and his friends seem to be in great apprehension
that <i>they</i> might, if there were no law to keep them
from it, I give him the most solemn pledge that I
will to the very last stand by the law of this State,
which forbids the marrying of white people with
negroes.&quot;</p>

<p>By all this it is made entirely evident that
Lincoln held a faith widely different from that
of the great crusading leaders of Abolitionism at
the East.<a name='FNanchor_84_84'></a><a href='#Footnote_84_84'><sup>[84]</sup></a>
 Equally marked was the difference between
him and them in the matters of temper and
of the attitude taken towards opponents. The absence
of any sense of personal hostility towards
those who assailed him with unsparing vindictiveness
was a trait often illustrated in his after life,
and which was now noted with surprise, for it was
rare in the excited politics of those days. In this
especial campaign both contestants honestly intended
to refrain from personalities, but the difference
between their ways of doing so was marked.
Douglas, under the temptation of high ability in
that line, held himself in check by an effort which
was often obvious and not always entirely successful.
<!-- Image No 162 --><a name='Png162'></a><a name='Page138'></a><span class="pagenum">138</span>
But Lincoln never seemed moved by the
desire. &quot;All I have to ask,&quot; he said, &quot;is that we
talk reasonably and rationally;&quot; and again: &quot;I
hope to deal in all things fairly with Judge Douglas.&quot;
No innuendo, no artifice, in any speech,
gave the lie to these protestations. Besides this,
his denunciations were always against <i>slavery</i>,
and never against <i>slaveholders</i>. The emphasis of
condemnation, the intensity of feeling, were never
expended against persons. By this course, unusual
among the Abolitionists, he not only lost nothing
in force and impressiveness, but, on the contrary,
his attack seemed to gain in effectiveness by being
directed against no personal object, but exclusively
against a practice. His war was against slavery,
not against the men and women of the South who
owned slaves. At Ottawa he read from the Peoria
speech of 1854: &quot;I have no prejudice against the
Southern people. They are just what we would
[should] be in their situation. If slavery did not
now exist among them, they would not introduce
it. If it did now exist among us, we should not
instantly give it up.... It does seem to me that
systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted;
but for their tardiness in this, I will not undertake
to judge our brethren of the South.&quot; Repeatedly
he admitted the difficulty of the problem, and fastened
no blame upon those Southerners who excused
themselves for not expelling the evil on the ground
that they did not know how to do so. At Peoria
he said: &quot;If all earthly power were given me,
<!-- Image No 163 --><a name='Png163'></a><a name='Page139'></a><span class="pagenum">139</span>
I should not know what to do as to the existing
institution.&quot; He contributed some suggestions
which certainly were nothing better than chimerical.
Deportation to Africa was his favorite
scheme; he also proposed that it would be &quot;best
for all concerned to have the colored population in
a State by themselves.&quot; But he did not abuse
men who declined to adopt his methods. Though
he was dealing with a question which was arousing
personal antagonisms as bitter as any that history
records, yet he never condemned any one, nor ever
passed judgment against his fellow men.</p>

<p>Diagnosis would perhaps show that the trait thus
illustrated was mental rather than moral. This
absence of animosity and reproach as towards individuals
found its root not so much in human
charity as in fairness of thinking. Lincoln's ways
of mental working are not difficult to discover.
He thought slowly, cautiously, profoundly, and
with a most close accuracy; but above all else he
<i>thought fairly</i>. This capacity far transcended,
or, more correctly, differed from, what is ordinarily
called the judicial habit of mind. Many men
can weigh arguments without letting prejudice get
into either scale; but Lincoln carried on the whole
process of thinking, not only with an equal clearness
of perception, but also with an entire impartiality
of liking or disliking for both sides. His
aim, while he was engaged in thinking, was to discover
what was really true; and later when he
spoke to others his purpose was to show them the
<!-- Image No 164 --><a name='Png164'></a><a name='Page140'></a><span class="pagenum">140</span>
truth which he had discovered, and to state to them
on what grounds he believed it to be the truth; it
did not involve a judgment against the individuals
who failed to recognize that truth. His singular
trait of impersonality was not made more apparent
in any other way. His effort never was to defeat
the person who happened to be his adversary, but
always was to overcome the arguments of that adversary.
Primarily he was discussing a topic and
establishing a truth; it was only incidental that in
doing these things he had to oppose a man. It is
noteworthy that his opponents never charged him
with misstating their case in order to make an apparently
effective answer to it. On the contrary,
his hope of success seemed always to lie in having
both sides presented with the highest degree of
clearness and honesty. He had perfect confidence
in the ultimate triumph of the truth; he was always
willing to tie fast to it, according as he could
see it, and then to bide time with it. This being
a genuine faith and not mere lip-service, he used
the same arguments to others which he used to himself,
and staked his final success upon the probability
that what had persuaded his mind would in
time persuade also the minds of other intelligent
men. It has been well said of him by an excellent
judge: &quot;He loved the truth for the truth's sake.
He would not argue from a false premise, or be deceived
himself, or deceive others, by a false conclusion....
He did not seek to say merely the thing
which was best for that day's debate, but the thing
<!-- Image No 165 --><a name='Png165'></a><a name='Page141'></a><span class="pagenum">141</span>
which would stand the test of time, and square itself
with eternal justice.... His logic was severe
and faultless. He did not resort to fallacy.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_85_85'></a><a href='#Footnote_85_85'><sup>[85]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>To return to the points made in the debate:
Douglas laid down the &quot;great principle of non-interference
and non-intervention by Congress
with slavery in the States and Territories alike;&quot;
which he assured his audience would enable us to
&quot;continue at peace with one another.&quot; In the
same connection he endeavored to silver-coat for
Northern palates the bitter pill of the Dred Scott
decision, by declaring that the people of any State
or Territory might withhold that protecting legislation,
those &quot;friendly police regulations,&quot; without
which slavery could not exist. But this was, indeed,
a &quot;lame, illogical, evasive answer,&quot; which
enabled Lincoln to &quot;secure an advantage in the
national relations of the contest which he held to
the end.&quot;</p>

<p>Lincoln, in replying, agreed that &quot;all the States
have the right to do exactly as they please about
all their domestic relations, including that of slavery.&quot;
But he said that the proposition that
slavery could not enter a new country without police
regulations was historically false; and that the
facts of the Dred Scott case itself showed that
there was &quot;vigor enough in slavery to plant itself in
a new country even against unfriendly legislation.&quot;
Beyond this issue of historical fact, Douglas had
already taken and still dared to maintain a position
<!-- Image No 166 --><a name='Png166'></a><a name='Page142'></a><span class="pagenum">142</span>
which proved to be singularly ill chosen. The right
to hold slaves as property in the Territories had
lately, to the infinite joy of the South, been declared
by the Supreme Court to be guaranteed by
the Constitution; and now Douglas had the audacity
to repeat that notion of his, so abhorrent to all
friends of slavery,&mdash;that this invaluable right could
be made practically worthless by unfriendly local
legislation, or even by the negative hostility of withholding
friendly legislation! From the moment
when this deadly suggestion fell from his ingenious
lips, the Southern Democracy turned upon him
with vindictive hate and marked him for destruction.
He had also given himself into the hands of
his avowed and natural enemies. The doctrine,
said Mr. Lincoln, is &quot;no less than that a thing
may lawfully be driven away from a place where
it has a lawful right to be.&quot; &quot;If you were elected
members of the legislature, what would be the first
thing you would have to do, before entering upon
your duties? <i>Swear to support the Constitution
of the United States</i>. Suppose you believe, as
Judge Douglas does, that the Constitution of the
United States guarantees to your neighbor the right
to hold slaves in that Territory,&mdash;that they are his
property,&mdash;how can you clear your oaths, unless
you give him such legislation as is necessary to
enable him to enjoy that property? What do you
understand by supporting the Constitution of a
State, or of the United States? Is it not to give
such constitutional helps to the rights established
<!-- Image No 167 --><a name='Png167'></a><a name='Page143'></a><span class="pagenum">143</span>
by that Constitution as may be practically needed?...
And what I say here will hold with still more
force against the judge's doctrine of 'unfriendly
legislation.' How could you, having sworn to support
the Constitution, and believing it guaranteed
the right to hold slaves in the Territories, assist in
legislation <i>intended to defeat that right</i>?&quot; &quot;Is
not Congress itself under obligation to give legislative
support to any right that is established under
the United States Constitution?&quot; Upon what
other principle do &quot;many of us, who are opposed
to slavery upon principle, give our acquiescence to
a Fugitive Slave Law?&quot; Does Douglas mean
to say that a territorial legislature, &quot;by passing
unfriendly laws,&quot; can &quot;<i>nullify a constitutional
right</i>?&quot; He put to Douglas the direct and embarrassing
query: &quot;If the slaveholding citizens
of a United States Territory should need and demand
congressional legislation for the protection
of their slave property in such Territory, would
you, as a member of Congress, vote for or against
such legislation?&quot; &quot;Repeat that,&quot; cried Douglas,
ostentatiously; &quot;I want to answer that question.&quot;
But he never composed his reply.</p>

<p>Another kindred question had already been put
by Lincoln: &quot;Can the people of a United States
Territory, in any lawful way, against the wish of
any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery
from its limits, prior to the formation of a State
Constitution?&quot; Friends advised him not to force
this, as it seemed against the immediate policy of
<!-- Image No 168 --><a name='Png168'></a><a name='Page144'></a><span class="pagenum">144</span>
the present campaign. But it was never his way
to subordinate his own deliberate opinion to the
opinions of advisers; and on this occasion he was
merciless in pressing this question. A story has
been very generally repeated that he told the protesters
that, whatever might be the bearing on the
senatorship, Douglas could not answer that question
and be elected President of the United States
in 1860. &quot;I am killing larger game,&quot; he said;
&quot;the battle of 1860 is worth a hundred of this.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_86_86'></a><a href='#Footnote_86_86'><sup>[86]</sup></a>

A few legends of this kind are extant, which tend
to indicate that Lincoln already had in mind the
presidential nomination, and was fighting the present
fight with an eye to that greater one in the
near future. It is not easy to say how much credit
should be given to such tales; they may not be
wholly inventions, but a remark which is uttered
with little thought may later easily take on a strong
color in the light of subsequent developments.</p>

<p>In presenting the Republican side of the question
Lincoln seemed to feel a duty beyond that
of merely outarguing his opponent. He bore the
weighty burden of a responsibility graver than
personal success. He might prevail in the opinions
of his fellow citizens; without this instant triumph
he might so present his cause that the jury of posterity
would declare that the truth lay with him;
he might even convince both the present and the
<!-- Image No 169 --><a name='Png169'></a><a name='Page145'></a><span class="pagenum">145</span>
coming generations; and though achieving all
these triumphs, he might still fall far short of the
peculiar and exacting requirement of the occasion.
For the winning of the senatorship was the insignificant
part of what he had undertaken; his momentous
charge was to maintain a grand moral
crusade, to stimulate and to vindicate a great uprising
in the cause of humanity and of justice.
His full appreciation of this is entirely manifest in
the tone of his speeches. They have an earnestness,
a gravity, at times even a solemnity, unusual
in such encounters in any era or before any audiences,
but unprecedented &quot;on the stump&quot; before
the uproarious gatherings of the West at that day.
Repeatedly he stigmatized slavery as &quot;a moral, a
social, a political evil.&quot; Very impressively he denounced
the positions of an opponent who &quot;cared
not whether slavery was voted down or voted up,&quot;
who said that slavery was not to be differentiated
from the many domestic institutions and daily
affairs which civilized societies control by police
regulations. He said that slavery could not be
treated as &quot;only equal to the cranberry laws of
Indiana;&quot; that slaves could not be put &quot;upon a
par with onions and potatoes;&quot; that to Douglas he
supposed that the institution really &quot;looked small,&quot;
but that a great proportion of the American people
regarded slavery as &quot;a vast moral evil.&quot; &quot;The
real issue in this controversy&mdash;the one pressing
upon every mind&mdash;is the sentiment on the part of
one class that looks upon the institution of slavery
<!-- Image No 170 --><a name='Png170'></a><a name='Page146'></a><span class="pagenum">146</span>
<i>as a wrong</i>, and of another class that does <i>not</i> look
upon it as a wrong.... No man can logically
say he does not care whether a wrong is voted up
or voted down. He [Douglas] contends that whatever
community wants slaves has a right to have
them. So they have, if it is not a wrong. But if
it is a wrong, he cannot say people have a right to
do wrong. He says that, upon the score of equality,
slaves should be allowed to go into a new Territory,
like other property. This is strictly logical
if there is no difference between it and other property....
But if you insist that one is wrong and
the other right, there is no use to institute a comparison
between right and wrong.... That is the
real issue. That is the issue that will continue in
this country when these poor tongues of Judge
Douglas and myself shall be silent. It is the eternal
struggle between these two principles, right
and wrong, throughout the world. They are the
two principles that have stood face to face from
the beginning of time, and will ever continue to
struggle. The one is the common right of humanity,
and the other the divine right of kings. It is
the same principle in whatever shape it develops
itself. It is the same spirit that says: 'You work
and toil and earn bread, and I'll eat it.'&quot; &quot;I ask
you if it is not a false philosophy? Is it not a
false statesmanship that undertakes to build up
a system of policy upon the basis of caring nothing
about <i>the very thing that everybody does care the
most about</i>?&quot;</p>

<p><!-- Image No 171 --><a name='Png171'></a><a name='Page147'></a><span class="pagenum">147</span>
We cannot leave these speeches without a word
concerning their literary quality. In them we
might have looked for vigor that would be a little
uncouth, wit that would be often coarse, a logic
generally sound but always clumsy,&mdash;in a word,
tolerably good substance and very poor form. We
are surprised, then, to find many and high excellences
in art. As it is with Bacon's essays, so it
is with these speeches: the more attentively they
are read the more striking appears the closeness
of their texture both in logic and in language.
Clear thought is accurately expressed. Each sentence
has its special errand, and each word its
individual importance. There is never either too
much or too little. The work is done with clean
precision and no waste. Nowhere does one pause
to seek a meaning or to recover a connection; and
an effort to make out a syllabus shows that the
most condensed statement has already been used.
There are scintillations of wit and humor, but they
are not very numerous. When Lincoln was urged
to adopt a more popular style, he replied: &quot;The
occasion is too serious; the issues are too grave.
I do not seek applause, or to amuse the people, but
to convince them.&quot; This spirit was upon him
from the beginning to the end. Had he been addressing
a bench of judges, subject to a close limitation
of minutes, he would have won credit by the
combined economy and force which were displayed
in these harangues to general assemblages. To
speak of the lofty tone of these speeches comes
<!-- Image No 172 --><a name='Png172'></a><a name='Page148'></a><span class="pagenum">148</span>
dangerously near to the distasteful phraseology of
extravagant laudation, than which nothing else can
produce upon honest men a worse impression.
Yet it is a truth visible to every reader that at
the outset Lincoln raised the discussion to a very
high plane, and held it there throughout. The
truth which he had to sustain was so great that it
was perfectly simple, and he had the good sense to
utter it with appropriate simplicity. In no speech
was there fervor or enthusiasm or rhetoric; he
talked to the reason and the conscience of his auditors,
not to their passions. Yet the depth of his
feeling may be measured by the story that once in
the canvass he said to a friend: &quot;Sometimes, in
the excitement of speaking, I seem to see the end
of slavery. I feel that the time is soon coming
when the sun shall shine, the rain fall, on no man
who shall go forth to unrequited toil. How this
will come, when it will come, by whom it will
come, I cannot tell,&mdash;but that time will surely
come.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_87_87'></a><a href='#Footnote_87_87'><sup>[87]</sup></a>
 It is just appreciation, and not extravagance,
to say that the cheap and miserable little
volume, now out of print, containing in bad newspaper
type, &quot;The Lincoln and Douglas Debates,&quot;<a name='FNanchor_88_88'></a><a href='#Footnote_88_88'><sup>[88]</sup></a>

<!-- Image No 173 --><a name='Png173'></a><a name='Page149'></a><span class="pagenum">149</span>
holds some of the masterpieces of oratory of all
ages and nations.</p>

<p>The immediate result of the campaign was the
triumph of Douglas, who had certainly made not
only a very able and brilliant but a splendidly
gallant fight, with Republicans assailing him in
front and Administrationists in rear.<a name='FNanchor_89_89'></a><a href='#Footnote_89_89'><sup>[89]</sup></a>
 Lincoln
was disappointed. His feelings had been so deeply
engaged, he had worked so strenuously, and the
result had been so much in doubt, that defeat
was trying. But he bore it with his wonted resolute
equanimity. He said that he felt &quot;like the
boy that stumped his toe,&mdash;'it hurt too bad to
laugh, and he was too big to cry.'&quot; In fact, there
were encouraging elements.<a name='FNanchor_90_90'></a><a href='#Footnote_90_90'><sup>[90]</sup></a>
 The popular vote
stood,<a name='FNanchor_91_91'></a><a href='#Footnote_91_91'><sup>[91]</sup></a>
 Republicans, 126,084; Douglas Democrats,
121,940; Lecompton Democrats, 5,091. But the
apportionment of districts was such that the legislature
contained a majority for Douglas.<a name='FNanchor_92_92'></a><a href='#Footnote_92_92'><sup>[92]</sup></a>
 So
the prestige of victory seemed separated from its
fruits; for the nation, attentively watching this
duel, saw that the new man had convinced upwards
of four thousand voters more than had the great
<!-- Image No 174 --><a name='Png174'></a><a name='Page150'></a><span class="pagenum">150</span>
leader of the Democracy. Douglas is reported to
have said that, during his sixteen years in Congress,
he had found no man in the Senate whom he
would not rather encounter in debate than Lincoln.
If it was true that Lincoln was already dreaming
of the presidency, he was a sufficiently shrewd
politician to see that his prospects were greatly
improved by this campaign. He had worked hard
for what he had gained; he had been traveling
incessantly to and fro and delivering speeches in
unbroken succession during about one hundred
of the hot days of the Western summer, and
speeches not of a commonplace kind, but which
severely taxed the speaker. After all was over,
he was asked by the state committee to contribute
to the campaign purse! He replied: &quot;I am
willing to pay according to my ability, but I am
the poorest hand living to get others to pay. <i>I
have been on expense</i> so long, without earning
anything, that I am absolutely without money now
for even household expenses. Still, if you can put

and I settle the private matter between us. This,
with what I have already paid,... will exceed
my subscription of $500. This, too, is exclusive
of my ordinary expenses during the campaign, all
of which being added to my loss of time and business
bears pretty heavily upon one no better off
than I am.... You are feeling badly; 'and this,
too, shall pass away;' never fear.&quot;</p>

<p>The platform which, with such precision and
<!-- Image No 175 --><a name='Png175'></a><a name='Page151'></a><span class="pagenum">151</span>
painstaking, Lincoln had constructed for himself
was made by him even more ample and more
strong by a few speeches delivered in the interval
between the close of this great campaign and his
nomination by the Republicans for the presidency.
In Ohio an important canvass for the governorship
took place, and Douglas went there, and
made speeches filled with allusions to Lincoln and
the recent Illinois campaign. Even without this
provocation Lincoln knew, by keen instinct, that
where Douglas was, there he should be also. In
no other way had he yet appeared to such advantage
as in encountering &quot;the Little Giant.&quot; To
Ohio, accordingly, he hastened, and spoke at Columbus
and at Cincinnati.<a name='FNanchor_93_93'></a><a href='#Footnote_93_93'><sup>[93]</sup></a>
 To the citizens of the
latter place he said: &quot;This is the first time in
my life that I have appeared before an audience
in so great a city as this. I therefore make this
appearance under some degree of embarrassment.&quot;
There was little novelty in substance, but much in
treatment. Thus, at Cincinnati, he imagined himself
addressing Kentuckians, and showed them that
their next nominee for the presidency ought to be
his &quot;distinguished friend, Judge Douglas;&quot; for
&quot;in all that there is a difference between you and
him, I understand he is sincerely for you, and
more wisely for you than you are for yourselves.&quot;
Through him alone pro-slavery men retained any
hold upon the free States of the North; and in
<!-- Image No 176 --><a name='Png176'></a><a name='Page152'></a><span class="pagenum">152</span>
those States, &quot;in every possible way he can, he
constantly moulds the public opinion to your
ends.&quot; Ingeniously but fairly he sketched Douglas
as the most efficient among the pro-slavery
leaders. Perhaps the clever and truthful picture
may have led Mr. Greeley and some other gentlemen
at the East to suspect that they had been
inconsiderate in their choice between the Western
rivals; and perhaps, also, Lincoln, while addressing
imaginary Kentuckians, had before his inner
eye some Eastern auditors. For at the time he
did not know that his voice would ever be heard
at any point nearer to their ears than the hall in
which he then stood. Within a few weeks, however,
this unlooked-for good fortune befell. In
October, 1859, he was invited to speak in the
following winter in New York. That the anti-slavery
men of that city wished to test him by personal
observation signified that his reputation was
national, and that the highest aspirations were,
therefore, not altogether presumptuous. He accepted
gladly, and immediately began to prepare
an address which probably cost him more labor
than any other speech which he ever made. He
found time, however, in December to make a journey
through Kansas, where he delivered several
speeches, which have not been preserved but are
described as &quot;repetitions of those previously made
in Illinois.&quot; Lamon tells us that the journey was
an &quot;ovation,&quot; and that &quot;wherever Lincoln went,
he was met by vast assemblages of people.&quot; The
<!-- Image No 177 --><a name='Png177'></a><a name='Page153'></a><span class="pagenum">153</span>
population of this agricultural State was hardly
in a condition to furnish &quot;vast assemblages&quot; at
numerous points, but doubtless the visitor received
gratifying assurance that upon this battle-ground
of slavery and anti-slavery the winning party
warmly appreciated his advocacy of their cause.</p>

<p>On Saturday, February 25, 1860, Lincoln arrived
in New York. On Monday his hosts &quot;found
him dressed in a sleek and shining suit of new
black, covered with very apparent creases and
wrinkles, acquired by being packed too closely
and too long in his little valise. He felt uneasy in
his new clothes and a strange place.&quot; Certainly
nothing in his previous experience had prepared
him to meet with entire indifference an audience of
metropolitan critics; indeed, had the surroundings
been more familiar, he had enough at stake to tax
his equanimity when William Cullen Bryant introduced
him simply as &quot;an eminent citizen of the
West, hitherto known to you only by reputation.&quot;
Probably the first impression made upon those
auditors by the ungainly Westerner in his outlandish
garb were not the same which they carried
home with them a little later. The speech was so
condensed that a sketch of it is not possible. Fortunately
it had the excellent quality of steadily
expanding in interest and improving to the end.</p>

<p>Of the Dred Scott case he cleverly said that the
courts had decided it &quot;<i>in a sort of way</i>;&quot; but,
after all, the decision was &quot;mainly based upon a
mistaken statement of fact,&mdash;the statement in the
<!-- Image No 178 --><a name='Png178'></a><a name='Page154'></a><span class="pagenum">154</span>
opinion that 'the right of property in a slave is
distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution.'&quot;</p>

<p>In closing, he begged the Republicans, in behalf
of peace and harmony, to &quot;do nothing through
passion and ill-temper;&quot; but he immediately went
on to show the antagonism between Republican
opinion and Democratic opinion with a distinctness
which left no hope of harmony, and very little
hope of peace. To satisfy the Southerners, he
said, we must &quot;cease to call slavery <i>wrong</i>, and
join them in calling it <i>right</i>. And this must be
done thoroughly,&mdash;done in <i>acts</i> as well as in
<i>words</i>.... We must arrest and return their
fugitive slaves with greedy pleasure. We must
pull down our free-state Constitutions.... If slavery
is right, all words, acts, laws, and constitutions
against it are themselves wrong, and should
be silenced and swept away. If it is right, we
cannot object to its nationality, its universality;
if it is wrong, they cannot justly insist upon its
extension, its enlargement. All they ask we could
readily grant, if we thought slavery right; all we
ask they could as readily grant, if they thought it
wrong. Their thinking it right and our thinking
it wrong is the precise fact upon which depends
the whole controversy. Thinking it right, as they
do, they are not to blame for desiring its full recognition,
as being right; but thinking it wrong, as
we do, can we yield to them?... Wrong as we
think slavery is, we can yet afford to let it alone
<!-- Image No 179 --><a name='Png179'></a><a name='Page155'></a><span class="pagenum">155</span>
where it is, because that much is due to the necessity
arising from its actual presence in the nation;
but can we, while our votes will prevent it, allow
it to spread into the national Territories, and to
overrun us here in these free States? If our sense
of duty forbids this ... let us be diverted by no
sophistical contrivances, such as groping for some
middle ground between the right and the wrong,
vain as the search for a man who should be neither
a living man nor a dead man; such as a policy of
'don't care' on a question about which all true
men do care; such as Union appeals beseeching
true Union men to yield to Disunionists, reversing
the divine rule and calling not the sinners but the
righteous to repentance.&quot;</p>

<p>The next morning the best newspapers gave full
reports of the speech, with compliments. The
columns of the &quot;Evening Post&quot; were generously
declared to be &quot;indefinitely elastic&quot; for such utterances;
and the &quot;Tribune&quot; expressed commendation
wholly out of accord with the recent notions
of its editor. The rough fellow from the crude
West had made a powerful impression upon the
cultivated gentlemen of the East.</p>

<p>From New York Lincoln went to Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Connecticut.
In this last-named State he delivered speeches
which are said to have contributed largely to the
Republican success in the closely contested election
then at hand. In Manchester it was noticed that
&quot;he did not abuse the South, the administration,
<!-- Image No 180 --><a name='Png180'></a><a name='Page156'></a><span class="pagenum">156</span>
or the Democrats, or indulge in any personalities,
with the exception of a few hits at Douglas's notions.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_94_94'></a><a href='#Footnote_94_94'><sup>[94]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>These speeches of 1858, 1859, and 1860 have a
very great value as contributions to history. During
that period every dweller in the United States
was hotly concerned about this absorbing question
of slavery, advancing his own views, weighing or
encountering the arguments of others, quarreling,
perhaps, with his oldest friends and his nearest
kindred,&mdash;for about this matter men easily quarreled
and rarely compromised. Every man who
fancied that he could speak in public got upon
some platform in city, town, or village, and secured
an audience by his topic if not by his ability; every
one who thought that he could write found some
way to print what he had to say upon a subject of
which readers never tired; and for whatever purpose
two or three men were gathered together, they
were not likely to separate without a few words
about North and South, pro-slavery and anti-slavery.
Never was any matter more harried and
ransacked by disputation. Now to all the speaking
and writing of the Republicans Lincoln's condensed
speeches were what a syllabus is to an elaborate
discourse, what a lawyer's brief is to his verbal
argument. Perhaps they may better be likened to
an anti-slavery gospel; as the New Testament is
supposed to cover the whole ground of Christian
doctrines and Christian ethics, so that theologians
<!-- Image No 181 --><a name='Png181'></a><a name='Page157'></a><span class="pagenum">157</span>
and preachers innumerable have only been able to
make elaborations or glosses upon the original text,
so Lincoln's speeches contain the whole basis of
the anti-slavery cause as maintained by the Republican
party. They also set forth a considerable
part of the Southern position, doubtless as fairly
as the machinations of the Devil are set forth in
Holy Writ. They only rather gingerly refrain
from speaking of the small body of ultra-Abolitionists,
&mdash;for while Lincoln was far from agreeing
with these zealots, he felt that it was undesirable
to widen by any excavation upon his side the chasm
between them and the Republicans. So the fact
is that the whole doctrine of Republicanism, as it
existed during the political campaign which resulted
in the election of Lincoln, also all the historical
facts supporting that doctrine, were clearly
and accurately stated in these speeches. Specific
points were more elaborated by other persons; but
every seed was to be found in this granary.</p>

<p>This being the case, it is worth noticing that
both Lincoln and Douglas confined their disputation
closely to the slavery question. Disunion
and secession were words familiar in every ear,
yet Lincoln referred to these things only twice
or thrice, and incidentally, while Douglas ignored
them. This fact is fraught with meaning. American
writers and American readers have always
met upon the tacit understanding that the Union
was the chief cause of, and the best justification
for, the war. An age may come when historians,
<!-- Image No 182 --><a name='Png182'></a><a name='Page158'></a><span class="pagenum">158</span>
treating our history as we treat that of Greece,
stirred by no emotion at the sight of the &quot;Stars
and Stripes,&quot; moved by no patriotism at the name
of the United States of America, will seek a deeper
philosophy to explain this obstinate, bloody, costly
struggle. Such writers may say that a rich, civilized
multitude of human beings, possessors of the
quarter of a continent, believing it best for their
interests to set up an independent government for
themselves, fell back upon the right of revolution,
though they chose not to call it by that name.
Now, even if it be possible to go so far as to say
that every nation has always a right to preserve
by force, if it can, its own integrity, certainly it
cannot be stated as a further truth that no portion
of a nation can ever be justified in endeavoring
to obtain an independent national existence;
no citizen of this country can admit this, but must
say that such an endeavor is justifiable or not justifiable
according as its cause and basis are right
or wrong. Far down, then, at the very bottom
lay the question whether the Southerners had a
sufficient cause upon which to base a revolution.
Now this question was hardly conclusively answered
by the perfectly true statement that the North had
not interfered with Southern rights. Southerners
might admit this, and still believe that their welfare
could be best subserved by a government wholly
their own. So the very bottom question of all still
remained: Was the South endeavoring to establish
a government of its own for a justifiable reason
<!-- Image No 183 --><a name='Png183'></a><a name='Page159'></a><span class="pagenum">159</span>
and a right purpose? Now the avowed purpose
was to establish on an enduring foundation a
permanent slave empire; and the declared reason
was, that slavery was not safe within the Union.
Underneath the question of the Union therefore
lay, logically, the question of slavery.</p>

<p>Lincoln and the other Republican leaders said
that, if slavery extension was prevented, then slavery
was in the way of extinction. If the assertion
was true, it pretty clearly followed that the South
could retain slavery only by independence and a
complete imperial control within the limits of its
own homogeneous nationality; for undeniably the
preponderant Northern mass was becoming firmly
resolved that slavery should not be extended, however
it might be tolerated within its present limits.
So still, by anti-slavery statement itself, the
ultimate question was: whether or not the preservation
of slavery was a right and sufficient cause
or purpose for establishing an independent nationality.
Lincoln, therefore, went direct to the logical
heart of the contention, when he said that the real
dispute was whether slavery was a right thing or
a wrong thing. If slavery was a right thing, a
Union conducted upon a policy which was believed
to doom it to &quot;ultimate extinction&quot; was not
a right thing. But if slavery was a wrong thing,
a revolution undertaken with the purpose of making
it perpetual was also a wrong thing. Therefore,
from beginning to end, Lincoln talked about
slavery. By so doing he did what he could to give
<!-- Image No 184 --><a name='Png184'></a><a name='Page160'></a><span class="pagenum">160</span>
to the war a character far higher even than a war
of patriotism, for he extended its meaning far beyond
the age and the country of its occurrence,
and made of it, not a war for the United States
alone, but a war for humanity, a war for ages and
peoples yet to come. In like manner, he himself
also gained the right to be regarded as much more
than a great party leader, even more than a great
patriot; for he became a champion of mankind and
the defender of the chief right of man. I do not
mean to say that he saw these things in this light
at the moment, or that he accurately formulated
the precise relationship and fundamental significance
of all that was then in process of saying and
doing. Time must elapse, and distance must enable
one to get a comprehensive view, before the
philosophy of an era like that of the civil war
becomes intelligible. But the philosophy is not
the less correct because those who were framing
it piece by piece did not at any one moment project
before their mental vision the whole in its
finished proportions and relationship.</p>

 Several months afterward, October 25, 1858, Mr. Seward made
the speech at Rochester which contained the famous sentence:
&quot;It is an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring
forces, and it means that the United States must and will, sooner
or later, become either entirely a slaveholding nation or entirely
a free-labor nation.&quot; Seward's <i>Works</i>, new edition, 1884, iv. 292.
But Seward ranked among the extremists and the agitators. See

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h2>ELECTION</h2>

<p>Mr. J.W. Fell, a leading citizen of Illinois,
says that after the debates of 1858 he urged Lincoln
to seek the Republican nomination for the
presidency in 1860. Lincoln, however, replied
curtly that men like Seward and Chase were entitled
to take precedence, and that no such &quot;good
luck&quot; was in store for him. In March, 1859, he
wrote to another person: &quot;In regard to the other
matter that you speak of, I beg that you will not
give it further mention. I do not think I am
fit for the presidency.&quot; He said the same to the
editor of the &quot;Central Illinois Gazette;&quot; but this
gentleman &quot;brought him out in the issue of May
4,&quot; and &quot;thence the movement spread rapidly and
strongly.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_95_97'></a><a href='#Footnote_95_97'><sup>[95]</sup></a>
 In the winter of 1859-60 sundry
&quot;intimate friends,&quot; active politicians of Illinois,
pressed him to consent to be mentioned as a candidate.
He considered the matter over night and
then gave them the desired permission, at the same
time saying that he would not accept the vice-presidency.</p>

<p>Being now fairly started in the race, he used all
his well-known skill as a politician to forward his
<!-- Image No 186 --><a name='Png186'></a><a name='Page162'></a><span class="pagenum">162</span>
campaign, though nothing derogatory is to be inferred
from these words as to his conduct or methods.
February 9, 1860, he wrote to Mr. Judd:
&quot;I am not in a position where it would hurt much
for me not to be nominated on the national ticket;
but I am where it would hurt some for me not to
get the Illinois delegates.... Can you help me a
little in this matter at your end of the vineyard?&quot;
This point of the allegiance of his own State was
soon made right. The Republican State Convention
met in the &quot;Wigwam&quot; at Decatur, May 9
and 10, 1860. Governor Oglesby, who presided,
suggested that a distinguished citizen, whom Illinois
delighted to honor, was present, and that he
should be invited to a place on the stand; and
at once, amid a tumult of applause, Lincoln was
lifted over the heads of the crowd to the platform.
John Hanks then theatrically entered, bearing a
couple of fence rails, and a flag with the legend
that they were from a &quot;lot made by Abraham
Lincoln and John Hanks in the Sangamon Bottom,
in the year 1830.&quot; The sympathetic roar
rose again. Then Lincoln made a &quot;speech,&quot; appropriate
to the occasion. At last, attention was
given to business, and the convention resolved
that Abraham Lincoln was the first choice of the
Republican party of Illinois for the presidency,
and instructed their delegates to the nominating
convention &quot;to use all honorable means to secure
his nomination, and to cast the vote of the State as
a unit for him.&quot;</p>

<p><!-- Image No 187 --><a name='Png187'></a><a name='Page163'></a><span class="pagenum">163</span>
With the opening of the spring of 1860 the several
parties began the campaign in earnest. The
Democratic Convention met first, at Charleston,
April 23; and immediately the line of disruption
opened. Upon the one side stood Douglas, with
the moderate men and nearly all the Northern
delegates, while against him were the advocates
of extreme Southern doctrines, supported by the
administration and by most of the delegates from
the &quot;Cotton States.&quot; The majority of the committee
appointed to draft the platform were anti-Douglas
men; but their report was rejected, and
that offered by the pro-Douglas minority was substituted,
165 yeas to 138 nays.<a name='FNanchor_96_98'></a><a href='#Footnote_96_98'><sup>[96]</sup></a>
 Thereupon the
delegations of Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, and
Texas, and sundry delegates from other States,
withdrew from the convention,<a name='FNanchor_97_99'></a><a href='#Footnote_97_99'><sup>[97]</sup></a>
 taking away 45
votes out of a total of 303. Those who remained
declared the vote of two thirds of a full convention,
<i>i.e.</i>, 202 votes, to be necessary for a choice.
Then during three days fifty-seven ballots were
cast, Douglas being always far in the lead, but
never polling more than 1521/2 votes. At last, on
May 3, an adjournment was had until June 18,
at Baltimore. At this second meeting contesting
<!-- Image No 188 --><a name='Png188'></a><a name='Page164'></a><span class="pagenum">164</span>
delegations appeared, and the decisions were uniformly
in favor of the Douglas men, which provoked
another secession of the extremist Southern
men. A ballot showed 1731/2 votes for Douglas out
of a total of 1911/2; the total was less than two
thirds of the full number of the original convention,
and therefore it was decided that any person
receiving two thirds of the votes cast by the
delegates present should be deemed the nominee.
The next ballot gave Douglass 1811/2. Herschel V.
Johnson of Georgia was nominated for vice-president.</p>

<p>On June 28, also at Baltimore, there came together
a collection composed of original seceders
at Charleston, and of some who had been rejected
and others who had seceded at Baltimore. Very
few Northern men were present, and the body in
fact represented the Southern wing of the Democracy.
Having, like its competitor, the merit of
knowing its own mind, it promptly nominated
John C. Breckenridge of Kentucky and Joseph
Lane of Oregon, and adopted the radical platform
which had been reported at Charleston.</p>

<p>These doings opened, so that it could never be
closed, that seam of which the thread had long
been visible athwart the surface of the old Democratic
party. The great record of discipline and
of triumph, which the party had made when united
beneath the dominion of imperious leaders, was
over, and forever. Those questions which Lincoln
obstinately and against advice had insisted upon
<!-- Image No 189 --><a name='Png189'></a><a name='Page165'></a><span class="pagenum">165</span>
pushing in 1858 had forced this disastrous development
of irreconcilable differences. The answers,
which Douglas could not shirk, had alienated the
most implacable of men, the dictators of the Southern
Democracy. His &quot;looking-both-ways&quot; theory
would not fit with their policy, and their policy
was and must be immutable; modification was in
itself defeat. On the other hand, what he said
constituted the doctrine to which the mass of the
Northern Democracy firmly held. So now, although
Republicans admitted that it was &quot;morally
certain&quot; that the Democratic party, holding
together, could carry the election,<a name='FNanchor_98_100'></a><a href='#Footnote_98_100'><sup>[98]</sup></a>
 yet these men
from the Cotton States could not take victory and
Douglas together.<a name='FNanchor_99_101'></a><a href='#Footnote_99_101'><sup>[99]</sup></a>
 It had actually come to this,
that, in spite of all that Douglas had done for the
slaveholders, they now marked him for destruction
at any cost. Many also believe that they had another
motive; that they had matured their plans
for secession; and that they did not mean to have
the scheme disturbed or postponed by an ostensibly
Democratic triumph in the shape of the election of
Douglas.</p>

<p>In May the convention of the Constitutional
Union party met, also at Baltimore. This organization
was a sudden outgrowth designed only to
meet the present emergency. Its whole political
doctrine lay in the opening words of the one resolution
which constituted its platform: &quot;That it is
<!-- Image No 190 --><a name='Png190'></a><a name='Page166'></a><span class="pagenum">166</span>
both the part of patriotism and of duty to recognize
no political principle other than the Constitution
of the country, the union of the States, and the
enforcement of the laws.&quot; This party gathered
nearly all the peaceable elements of the community;
it assumed a deprecatory attitude between
angry contestants, and of course received the abuse
and contempt of both; it was devoid of combative
force, yet had some numerical strength. The Republicans
especially mocked at these &quot;trimmers,&quot;
as if their only platform was moral cowardice,
which, however, was an unfair statement of their
position. The party died, of necessity, upon the
day when Lincoln was elected, and its members
were then distributed between the Republicans,
the Secessionists, and the Copperheads. John
Bell of Tennessee, the candidate for the presidency,
joined the Confederacy; Edward Everett
of Massachusetts, the candidate for the vice-presidency,
became a Republican. The party never
had a hope of electing its men; but its existence
increased the chance of throwing the election into
Congress; and this hope inspired exertions far
beyond what its own prospects warranted.</p>

<p>On May 16 the Republican Convention came
together at Chicago, where the great &quot;Wigwam&quot;
had been built to hold 10,000 persons. The intense
interest with which its action was watched
indicated the popular belief that probably it would
name the next President of the United States.
Many candidates were named, chiefly Seward, Lincoln,
<!-- Image No 191 --><a name='Png191'></a><a name='Page167'></a><span class="pagenum">167</span>
Chase, Cameron, Edward Bates of Missouri,
and William L. Dayton of New Jersey. Thurlow
Weed was Seward's lieutenant. Horace Greeley,
chiefly bent upon the defeat of Seward, would
have liked to achieve it by the success of Bates.
David Davis, aided by Judge Logan and a band
of personal friends from Illinois, was manager for
Lincoln. Primarily the contest lay between Seward
and Lincoln, and only a dead-lock between
these two could give a chance to some one of
the others. But Seward's friends hoped, and
Lincoln's friends dreaded, that the New Yorker
might win by a rush on the first ballot. George
Ashmun of Massachusetts presided. With little
discussion a platform was adopted, long and ill-written,
overloaded with adjectives and rhetoric,
sacrificing dignity to the supreme pleasure of
abusing the Democracy, but honest in stating
Republican doctrines, and clearly displaying the
temper of an earnest, aggressive party, hot for the
fight and confident of victory. The vote of acceptance
was greeted with such a cheering that &quot;a
herd of buffaloes or lions could not have made a
more tremendous roaring.&quot;</p>

<p>The details of the brief but sharp contest for
the nomination are not altogether gratifying. The
partisans of Seward set about winning votes by
much parading in the streets with banners and
music, and by out-yelling all competitors within
the walls of the convention. For this intelligent
purpose they had engaged Tom Hyer, the prize
<!-- Image No 192 --><a name='Png192'></a><a name='Page168'></a><span class="pagenum">168</span>
fighter, with a gang of roughs, to hold possession
of the Wigwam, and to howl illimitably at appropriate
moments. But they had undertaken a difficult
task in trying to outdo the great West, in one
of its own cities, at a game of this kind. The Lincoln
leaders in their turn secured a couple of stentorian
yellers (one of them a Democrat), instructed
them carefully, and then filled the Wigwam full
actually at daybreak, while the Seward men were
marching; so in the next yelling match the West
won magnificently. How great was the real efficiency
of these tactics in affecting the choice of
the ruler of a great nation commonly accounted
intelligent, it is difficult to say with accuracy; but
it is certain that the expert managers spared no
pains about this scenic business of &quot;enthusiasm.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile other work, entirely quiet, was being
done elsewhere. The objection to Seward was that
he was too radical, too far in advance of the party.
The Bates following were pushing their candidate
as a moderate man, who would be acceptable to
&quot;Union men.&quot; But Bates's chance was small,
and any tendency towards a moderate candidate
was likely to carry his friends to Lincoln rather
than to Seward; for Lincoln was generally supposed,
however erroneously,<a name='FNanchor_100_102'></a><a href='#Footnote_100_102'><sup>[100]</sup></a>
 to be more remote
from Abolitionism than Seward was. To counteract
this, a Seward delegate telegraphed to the
<!-- Image No 193 --><a name='Png193'></a><a name='Page169'></a><span class="pagenum">169</span>
Bates men at St. Louis that Lincoln was as radical
as Seward. Lincoln, at Springfield, saw this dispatch,
and at once wrote a message to David
Davis: &quot;Lincoln agrees with Seward in his irrepressible-conflict
idea, and in Negro Equality; but
he is opposed to Seward's Higher Law. <i>Make no
contracts that will bind me</i>.&quot; He underscored the
last sentence; but when his managers saw it, they
recognized that such independence did not accord
with the situation, and so they set it aside.</p>

<p>The first vote was:&mdash;</p>

<p>The fact was, and Lincoln's friends perfectly
understood it, that Cameron held that peculiar
kind of power which gave him no real prospect
of success, yet had a considerable salable value.
Could they refrain from trying the market? They
asked the owners of the 501/2 Cameron votes what
was their price. The owners said: The Treasury
Department. Lincoln's friends declared this
extravagant. Then they all chaffered. Finally
<!-- Image No 194 --><a name='Png194'></a><a name='Page170'></a><span class="pagenum">170</span>
Cameron's men took a place in the cabinet, without
further specification. Lamon says that another
smaller contract was made with the friends
of Caleb B. Smith. Then the Lincoln managers
rested in a pleasing sense of security.</p>

<p>Upon the third ballot delivery was made of what
Mr. Davis had bought. That epidemic foreknowledge,
which sometimes so unaccountably foreruns
an event, told the convention that the decision was

<p>Cameron was out of the race; Lincoln was
within 11/2 votes of the goal. Before the count
could be announced, a delegate from Ohio transferred
four votes to Lincoln. This settled the
matter; and then other delegations followed, till
Lincoln's score rose to 354. At once the &quot;enthusiasm&quot;
of 10,000 men again reduced to insignificance
<!-- Image No 195 --><a name='Png195'></a><a name='Page171'></a><span class="pagenum">171</span>
a &quot;herd of buffaloes or lions.&quot; When at last
quiet was restored, William M. Evarts, who had
led for Seward, offered the usual motion to make
the nomination of Abraham Lincoln unanimous.
It was done. Again the &quot;tremendous roaring&quot;
arose. Later in the day the convention nominated
Hannibal Hamlin<a name='FNanchor_101_103'></a><a href='#Footnote_101_103'><sup>[101]</sup></a>
 of Maine, on the second ballot,
by 367 votes, for the vice-presidency. Then for
many hours, till exhaustion brought rest, Chicago
was given over to the wonted follies; cannon
boomed, music resounded, and streets and barrooms
were filled with the howling and drinking
crowds of the intelligent promoters of one of the
great moral crusades of the human race.</p>

<p>Lamon says that the committee deputed to wait
upon Lincoln at Springfield found him &quot;sad and
dejected. The reaction from excessive joy to deep
despondency&mdash;a process peculiar to his constitution&mdash;had
already set in.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_102_104'></a><a href='#Footnote_102_104'><sup>[102]</sup></a>
 His remarks to these
gentlemen were brief and colorless. His letter
afterward was little more than a simple acceptance
of the platform.</p>

<hr class='short'/>

<p>Since white men first landed on this continent,
the selection of Washington to lead the army of
the Revolution is the only event to be compared
in good fortune with this nomination of Abraham
<!-- Image No 196 --><a name='Png196'></a><a name='Page172'></a><span class="pagenum">172</span>
Lincoln. Yet the convention deserved no credit
for its action. It did not know the true ratio between
Seward and Lincoln, which only the future
was to make plain. By all that it did know, it
ought to have given the honor to Seward, who
merited it by the high offices which he had held
with distinction and without blemish, by the leadership
which he had acquired in the party through
long-continued constancy and courage, by the force
and clearness with which he had maintained its
principles, by his experience and supposed natural
aptitude in the higher walks of statesmanship.
Yet actually by reason of these very qualifications<a name='FNanchor_103_105'></a><a href='#Footnote_103_105'><sup>[103]</sup></a>

it was now admitted that the all-important
&quot;October States&quot; of Indiana and Pennsylvania
could not be carried by the Republicans if Seward
were nominated; while Greeley, sitting in the
convention as a substitute for a delegate from
Oregon, cast as much of the weight of New York
as he could lift into the anti-Seward scale. In
plain fact, the convention, by its choice, paid no
compliment either to Lincoln or to the voters of
the party. They took him because he was &quot;available,&quot;
and the reason that he was &quot;available&quot; lay
not in any popular appreciation of his merits, but
in the contrary truth,&mdash;that the mass of people
could place no intelligent estimate upon him at
all, either for good or for ill. Outside of Illinois
<!-- Image No 197 --><a name='Png197'></a><a name='Page173'></a><span class="pagenum">173</span>
a few men, who had studied his speeches, esteemed
him an able man in debate; more had a vague
notion of him as an effective stump speaker of the
West; far the greatest number had to find out
about him.<a name='FNanchor_104_106'></a><a href='#Footnote_104_106'><sup>[104]</sup></a>
 In a word, Mr. Lincoln gained the
nomination because Mr. Seward had been &quot;too
conspicuous,&quot; whereas he himself was so little
known that it was possible for Wendell Phillips
to inquire indignantly: &quot;Who is this huckster in
politics? Who is this county court advocate?&quot;<a name='FNanchor_105_107'></a><a href='#Footnote_105_107'><sup>[105]</sup></a>

For these singular reasons he was the most &quot;available&quot;
candidate who could be offered before the
citizens of the United States!</p>

<p>It cannot be said that the nomination was received
with much satisfaction. &quot;Honest old Abe
the rail-splitter!&quot; might sound well in the ear of
the masses; but the Republican party was laden
with the burden of an immense responsibility, and
the men who did its thinking could not reasonably
feel certain that rail-splitting was an altogether
satisfactory training for the leader in such an era
as was now at hand. Nevertheless, nearly<a name='FNanchor_106_108'></a><a href='#Footnote_106_108'><sup>[106]</sup></a>
 all
came to the work of the campaign with as much
zeal as if they had surely known the full value
of their candidate. Shutting their minds against
doubts, they made the most spirited and energetic
canvass which has ever taken place in the country.
<!-- Image No 198 --><a name='Png198'></a><a name='Page174'></a><span class="pagenum">174</span>
The organization of the &quot;Wide-Awake&quot; clubs was
an effective success.<a name='FNanchor_107_109'></a><a href='#Footnote_107_109'><sup>[107]</sup></a>
 None who saw will ever forget
the spectacle presented by these processions
wherein many thousands of men, singing the campaign
songs, clad in uniform capes of red or white
oil-cloth, each with a flaming torch or a colored
lantern, marched nightly in every city and town
of the North, in apparently endless numbers and
with military precision, making the streets a brilliant
river of variously tinted flame. Torchlight
parades have become mere conventional affairs
since those days, when there was a spirit in them
which nothing has ever stirred more lately. They
were a good preparation for the more serious
marching and severer drill which were soon to
come, though the Republicans scoffed at all anticipations
of such a future, and sneered at the timid
ones who croaked of war and bloodshed.</p>

<p>Almost from the beginning it was highly probable
that the Republicans would win, and it was
substantially certain that none of their competitors
could do so. The only contrary chance was that
no election might be made by the people, and that
it might be thrown into Congress. Douglas with
his wonted spirit made a vigorous fight, traveling
to and fro, speaking constantly in the North and
a few times in the South, but defiant rather than
conciliatory in tone. He did not show one whit
the less energy because it was obvious that he
waged a contest without hope. If there were any
road to Democratic success, which it now seems
<!-- Image No 199 --><a name='Png199'></a><a name='Page175'></a><span class="pagenum">175</span>
that there was not, it lay in uniting the sundered
party. An attempt was made to arrange that
whichever Democratic candidate should ultimately
display the greater strength should receive the full
support of the party. Projects for a fusion ticket
met with some success in New York. In Pennsylvania
like schemes were imperfectly successful.
In other Northern States they were received with
scant favor. Except some followers of Bell and
Everett, men were in no temper for compromise.
At the South fusion was not even attempted; the
Breckenridge men would not hear of it; the voters
in that section were controlled by leaders, and
these leaders probably had a very distinct policy,
which would be seriously interfered with by the
triumph of the Douglas ticket.</p>

<p>The chief anxiety of Lincoln and the Republican
leaders was lest some voters, who disagreed
with them only on less important issues, might stay
away from the polls. All the platforms, except
that of the Constitutional Union party, touched
upon other topics besides the question of slavery
in the Territories; the tariff, native Americanism,
acquisition of Cuba, a transcontinental railway,
public lands, internal improvements, all found
mention. The Know-Nothing party still by occasional
twitchings showed that life had not quite
taken flight, and endeavors were made to induce
Lincoln to express his views. But he evaded it.<a name='FNanchor_108_110'></a><a href='#Footnote_108_110'><sup>[108]</sup></a>

<!-- Image No 200 --><a name='Png200'></a><a name='Page176'></a><span class="pagenum">176</span>
For above all else he wished to avoid the stirring
of any dissension upon side issues or minor
points; his hope was to see all opponents of the
extension of slavery put aside for a while all other
matters, refrain from discussing troublesome details,
and unite for the one broad end of putting
slavery where &quot;the fathers&quot; had left it, so that the
&quot;public mind should rest in the belief that it was
in the way of ultimate extinction.&quot; He felt it to
be fair and right that he should receive the votes
of all anti-slavery men; and ultimately he did,
with the exception only of the thorough-going
Abolitionists.</p>

<p>It was not so very long since he had spoken of
the Abolitionist leaders as &quot;friends;&quot; but they
did not reciprocate the feeling, nor indeed could
reasonably be expected to do so, or to vote the
Republican ticket. They were even less willing
to vote it with Lincoln at the head of it than if
Seward had been there.<a name='FNanchor_109_111'></a><a href='#Footnote_109_111'><sup>[109]</sup></a>
 But Republicanism itself
under any leader was distinctly at odds with their
views; for when they said &quot;<i>abolition</i>&quot; they meant
accurately what they said, and abolition certainly
was impossible under the Constitution. The Republicans,
and Lincoln personally, with equal directness
acknowledged the supremacy of the Constitution.
Lincoln, therefore, plainly asserted a
policy which the Abolitionists equally plainly condemned.
In their eyes, to be a party to a contract
maintaining slavery throughout a third of a continent
<!-- Image No 201 --><a name='Png201'></a><a name='Page177'></a><span class="pagenum">177</span>
was only a trifle less criminal than aiding to
extend it over another third. Yet it should be
said that the Abolitionists were not all of one
mind, and some voted the Republican ticket as being
at least a step in the right direction. Joshua
R. Giddings was a member of the Republican Convention
which nominated Lincoln. But Wendell
Phillips, always an extremist among extremists,
published an article entitled &quot;Abraham Lincoln,
the Slave-hound of Illinois,&quot; whereof the keynote
was struck in this introductory sentence: &quot;We
gibbet a Northern hound to-day, side by side with
the infamous Mason of Virginia.&quot; Mr. Garrison,
a man of far larger and sounder intellectual powers
than belonged to Phillips, did not fancy this
sort of diatribe, though five months earlier he had
accused the Republican party of &quot;slavish subserviency
to the Union,&quot; and declared it to be &quot;still
insanely engaged in glorifying the Union and
pledging itself to frown upon all attempts to dissolve

<p>Messrs. Nicolay and Hay say that Lincoln was
the &quot;indisputable choice of the American people,&quot;
and by way of sustaining the statement say that, if
the &quot;whole voting strength of the three opposing
parties had been united upon a single candidate,
<!-- Image No 203 --><a name='Png203'></a><a name='Page179'></a><span class="pagenum">179</span>
Lincoln would nevertheless have been chosen with
only a trifling diminution of his electoral majority.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_111_113'></a><a href='#Footnote_111_113'><sup>[111]</sup></a>

It might be better to say that Lincoln was
the &quot;indisputable choice&quot; of the electoral college.
The &quot;American people&quot; fell enormously short of
showing a majority in his favor. His career as
president was made infinitely more difficult as well
as greatly more creditable to him by reason of the
very fact that he was <i>not</i> the choice of the American
people, but of less than half of them,&mdash;and
this, too, even if the Confederate States be excluded
from the computation.<a name='FNanchor_112_114'></a><a href='#Footnote_112_114'><sup>[112]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>The election of Lincoln was &quot;hailed with delight&quot;
by the extremists in South Carolina; for it
signified secession, and the underlying and real
desire of these people was secession, and not either
compromise or postponement.<a name='FNanchor_113_115'></a><a href='#Footnote_113_115'><sup>[113]</sup></a>

The total popular vote was 4,680,193. Lincoln had 1,866,452.
In North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,
Texas, Arkansas, and Tennessee, no vote was cast for the
Lincoln ticket; in Virginia only 1929 voted it. Adding the total
popular vote of all these States (except the 1929), we get 854,775;
deducting this from the total popular vote leaves a balance of
3,825,418, of which one half is 1,912,709; so that even outside of

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h2>INTERREGNUM</h2>

<p>For a while now the people of the Northern
States were compelled passively to behold a spectacle
which they could not easily reconcile with the
theory of the supreme excellence and wisdom of
their system of government. Abraham Lincoln
was chosen President of the United States November
6, 1860; he was to be inaugurated March 4,
1861. During the intervening four months the
government must be conducted by a chief whose
political creed was condemned by an overwhelming
majority of the nation.<a name='FNanchor_114_116'></a><a href='#Footnote_114_116'><sup>[114]</sup></a>
 The situation was as unfair
for Mr. Buchanan as it was hurtful for the
people. As head of a republic, or, in the more
popular phrase, as the chief &quot;servant of the people,&quot;
he must respect the popular will, yet he could
not now administer the public business according
to that will without being untrue to all his own
convictions, and repudiating all his trusted counselors.
In a situation so intrinsically false efficient
government was impossible, no matter what
<!-- Image No 205 --><a name='Png205'></a><a name='Page181'></a><span class="pagenum">181</span>
was the strength or weakness of the hand at the
helm. Therefore there was every reason for displacing
Buchanan from control of the national
affairs in the autumn, and every reason against
continuing him in that control through the winter;
yet the law of the land ordained the latter course.
It seemed neither sensible nor even safe. During
this doleful period all descriptions of him agree:
he seemed, says Chittenden, &quot;shaken in body and
uncertain in mind,... an old man worn out by
worry;&quot; while the Southerners also declared him
as &quot;incapable of purpose as a child.&quot; To the like
purport spoke nearly all who saw him.</p>

<p>During the same time Lincoln's position was
equally absurd and more trying. After the lapse
of four months he was, by the brief ceremony of an
hour, to become the leader of a great nation under
an exceptionally awful responsibility; but during
those four months he could play no other part than
simply to watch, in utter powerlessness, the swift
succession of crowding events, which all were tending
to make his administration of the government
difficult, or even impossible. Throughout all this
long time, the third part of a year, which statutes
scarcely less venerable than the Constitution itself
freely presented to the disunion leaders, they safely
completed their civil and military organization,
while the Northerners, under a ruler whom they
had discredited, but of whom they could not get
rid, were paralyzed for all purposes of counter
preparation.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 206 --><a name='Png206'></a><a name='Page182'></a><span class="pagenum">182</span>
As a trifling compensation for its existence this
costly interregnum presents to later generations a
curious spectacle. A volume might be made of the
public utterances put forth in that time by men of
familiar names and more or less high repute, and
it would show many of them in most strange and
unexpected characters, so entirely out of keeping
with the years which they had lived before, and the
years which they were to live afterward, that the
reader would gaze in hopeless bewilderment. In
the &quot;solid&quot; South, so soon to be a great rebelling
unit, he would find perhaps half of the people
opposed to disunion; in the North he would hear
everywhere words of compromise and concession,
while coercion would be mentioned only to be denounced.
If these four months were useful in
bringing the men of the North to the fighting
point, on the other hand they gave an indispensable
opportunity for proselyting, by whirl and excitement,
great numbers at the South. Even in
the autumn of 1860 and in the Gulf States secession
was still so much the scheme of leaders that
there was no popular preponderance in favor of
disunion doctrines. In evidence of this are the
responses of governors to a circular letter of Governor
Gist of South Carolina, addressed to them
October 5, 1860, and seeking information as to the
feeling among the people. From North Carolina,
Louisiana, Georgia, and Alabama came replies that
secession was not likely to be favorably received.
Mississippi was non-committal. Louisiana, Georgia,
<!-- Image No 207 --><a name='Png207'></a><a name='Page183'></a><span class="pagenum">183</span>
and Alabama desired a convention of the discontented
States, and might be influenced by its
action. North Carolina, Louisiana, and Alabama
would oppose forcible coercion of a seceding State.
Florida alone was rhetorically belligerent. These
reports were discouraging in the ears of the extremist
governor; but against them he could set
the fact that the disunionists had the advantage
of being the aggressive, propagandist body, homogeneous,
and pursuing an accurate policy in entire
concert. They were willing to take any amount
of pains to manipulate and control the election of
delegates and the formal action of conventions, and
in all cases except that of Texas the question was
conclusively passed upon by conventions. By every
means they &quot;fired the Southern heart,&quot; which was
notoriously combustible; they stirred up a great tumult
of sentiment; they made thunderous speeches;
they kept distinguished emissaries moving to and
fro; they celebrated each success with an uproar
of cannonading, with bonfires, illuminations, and
processions; they appealed to those chivalrous virtues
supposed to be peculiar to Southerners; they
preached devotion to the State, love of the state
flag, generous loyalty to sister slave-communities;
sometimes they used insult, abuse, and intimidation;
occasionally they argued seductively. Thus
Mr. Cobb's assertion, that &quot;we can make better
terms out of the Union than in it,&quot; was, in the
opinion of Alexander H. Stephens, the chief influence
which carried Georgia out of the Union. In
<!-- Image No 208 --><a name='Png208'></a><a name='Page184'></a><span class="pagenum">184</span>
the main, however, it was the principle of state
sovereignty and state patriotism which proved the
one entirely trustworthy influence to bring over
the reluctant. &quot;I abhor disunion, but I go with
my State,&quot; was the common saying; and the States
were under skillful and resolute leadership. So,
though the popular discontent was far short of
the revolutionary point, yet individuals, one after
another, yielded to that sympathetic, emotional instinct
which tempts each man to fall in with the
big procession. In this way it was that during
the Buchanan interregnum the people of the Gulf
States became genuinely fused in rebellion.</p>

<p>It is not correct to say that the election of Lincoln
was the cause of the Rebellion; it was rather
the signal. To the Southern leaders, it was the
striking of the appointed hour. His defeat would
have meant only postponement. South Carolina
led the way. On December 17, 1860, her convention
came together, the Palmetto flag waving over
its chamber of conference, and on December 20
it issued its &quot;Ordinance.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_115_117'></a><a href='#Footnote_115_117'><sup>[115]</sup></a>
 This declared that
the Ordinance of May 23, 1788, ratifying the Constitution,
is &quot;hereby repealed,&quot; and the &quot;Union
now subsisting between South Carolina and other
States, under the name of the United States of
America, is hereby dissolved.&quot; A Declaration of
Causes said that South Carolina had &quot;resumed
her position among the nations of the world as a
<!-- Image No 209 --><a name='Png209'></a><a name='Page185'></a><span class="pagenum">185</span>
separate and independent State.&quot; The language
used was appropriate for the revocation of a power
of attorney. The people hailed this action with
noisy joy, unaccompanied by any regret or solemnity
at the severance of the old relationship. The
newspapers at once began to publish &quot;Foreign
News&quot; from the other States. The new governor,
Pickens, a fiery Secessionist, and described as one
&quot;born insensible to fear,&quot;&mdash;presumably the condition
of most persons at that early period of existence,&mdash;had
already suggested to Mr. Buchanan
the impropriety of reinforcing the national garrisons
in the forts in Charleston harbor. He now
accredited to the President three commissioners to
treat with him for the delivery of the &quot;forts, magazines,
lighthouses, and other real estate, with their
appurtenances, in the limits of South Carolina;
and also for an apportionment of the public debt,
and for a division of all other property held by the
government of the United States as agent of the
Confederate States of which South Carolina was
recently a member.&quot; This position, as of the dissolution
of a copartnership, or the revocation of an
agency, and an accounting of debts and assets, was
at least simple; and by way of expediting it an appraisal
of the &quot;real estate&quot; and &quot;appurtenances&quot;
within the state limits had been made by the state
government. Meanwhile there was in the harbor
of Charleston a sort of armed truce, which might
at any moment break into war. Major Anderson
in Fort Moultrie, and the state commander in the
<!-- Image No 210 --><a name='Png210'></a><a name='Page186'></a><span class="pagenum">186</span>
city, watched each other like two suspicious animals,
neither sure when the other will spring. In short,
in all the overt acts, the demeanor and the language
of this excitable State, there was such insolence,
besides hostility, that her emissaries must have
been surprised at the urbane courtesy with which
they were received, even by a President of Mr.
Buchanan's views.</p>

<p>After the secession of South Carolina the other
Gulf States hesitated briefly. Mississippi followed
first; her convention assembled January 7, 1861,
and on January 9 passed the ordinance, 84 yeas to
15 nays, subsequently making the vote unanimous.
The Florida convention met January 3, and on
January 10 decreed the State to be &quot;a sovereign
and independent nation,&quot; 62 yeas to 7 nays. The
Alabama convention passed its ordinance on January
11 by 61 yeas to 39 nays; the President announced
that the idea of reconstruction must be
forever &quot;dismissed.&quot; Yet the northern part of the
State appeared to be substantially anti-secession.
In Georgia the Secessionists doubted whether they
could control a convention, yet felt obliged to call
one. Toombs, Cobb, and Iverson labored with
tireless zeal throughout the State; but in spite of
all their proselyting, Unionist feeling ran high and
debate was hot. The members from the southern
part of the State ventured to menace and dragoon
those from the northern part, who were largely
Unionists. The latter retorted angrily; a schism
and personal collisions were narrowly avoided.
<!-- Image No 211 --><a name='Png211'></a><a name='Page187'></a><span class="pagenum">187</span>
Alexander H. Stephens spoke for the Union with
a warmth and logic not surpassed by anything
that was said at the North. He and Herschel
V. Johnson both voted against secession; yet, on
January 18, when the vote was taken, it showed
208 yeas against 89 nays. On January 26 Louisiana
followed, the vote of the convention being 113
yeas to 17 nays; but it refused to submit the ordinance
to the people for ratification. The action
of Texas, the only other State which seceded prior
to the inauguration of Lincoln, was delayed until
February 1. There Governor Houston was opposing
secession with such vigor as remained to a
broken old man, whereby he provoked Senator Iverson
to utter the threat of assassination: &quot;Some
Texan Brutus may arise to rid his country of this
old hoary-headed traitor.&quot; But in the convention,
when it came to voting, the yeas were 166, the nays
only 7.</p>

<p>By the light that was in him Mr. Buchanan was
a Unionist, but it was a sadly false and flickering
light, and beneath its feeble illumination his steps
staggered woefully. For two months he diverged
little from the path which the Secessionist leaders
would have marked out for him, had they controlled
his movements. At the time of the election his
cabinet was:&mdash;</p>

<div class="display">
<p>
Lewis Cass of Michigan, secretary of state.<br />
Howell Cobb of Georgia, secretary of the treasury.<br />
John B. Floyd of Virginia, secretary of war.<br />
Isaac Toucey of Connecticut, secretary of the navy.<br />
Jacob Thompson of Mississippi, secretary of the interior.<br />
<!-- Image No 212 --><a name='Png212'></a><a name='Page188'></a><span class="pagenum">188</span>
Aaron V. Brown of Tennessee, postmaster-general.<br />
Jeremiah S. Black of Pennsylvania, attorney-general.</p>
</div>

<p>Of these men Cobb, Floyd, and Thompson were
extreme Secessionists. Many felt that Cobb should
have been made President of the Southern Confederacy
instead of Davis. In December Thompson
went as commissioner from Mississippi to North
Carolina to persuade that State to secede, and did
not resign his place in the cabinet because, as he
said, Mr. Buchanan approved his mission.</p>

<p>Betwixt his own predilections and the influence
of these advisers Mr. Buchanan composed for the
Thirty-sixth Congress a message which carried consternation
among all Unionists. It was of little
consequence that he declared the present situation
to be the &quot;natural effect&quot; of the &quot;long-continued
and intemperate interference&quot; of the Northern
people with slavery. But it was of the most serious
consequence that, while he condemned secession
as unconstitutional, he also declared himself powerless
to prevent it. His duty &quot;to take care that
the laws be faithfully executed&quot; he knew no other
way to perform except by aiding federal officers
in the performance of their duties. But where,
as in South Carolina, the federal officers had all
resigned, so that none remained to be aided, what
was he to do? This was practically to take the
position that half a dozen men, by resigning their
offices, could make the preservation of the Union
<!-- Image No 213 --><a name='Png213'></a><a name='Page189'></a><span class="pagenum">189</span>
by its chief executive impossible!<a name='FNanchor_116_118'></a><a href='#Footnote_116_118'><sup>[116]</sup></a>
 Besides this,
Mr. Buchanan said that he had &quot;no authority to
decide what should be the relations between the
Federal government and South Carolina.&quot; He
afterward said that he desired to avoid a collision
of arms &quot;between this and any other government.&quot;
He did not seem to reflect that he had no right to
recognize a State of the Union as being an &quot;other
government,&quot; in the sense in which he used the
phrase, and that, by his very abstention from the
measures necessary for maintaining unchanged that
relationship which had hitherto existed, he became
a party to the establishment of a new relationship,
and that, too, of a character which he himself
alleged-to be unconstitutional. In truth, his chief
purpose was to rid himself of any responsibility
and to lay it all upon Congress. Yet he was willing
to advise Congress as to its powers and duties
in the business which he shirked in favor of that
body, saying that the power to coerce a seceding
State had not been delegated to it, and adding the
warning that &quot;the Union can never be cemented
by the blood of its citizens shed in civil war.&quot; So
the nation learned that its ruler was of opinion that
to resist the destruction of its nationality was both
unlawful and inexpedient.</p>

<p>If the conclusions of the message aroused alarm
<!-- Image No 214 --><a name='Png214'></a><a name='Page190'></a><span class="pagenum">190</span>
and indignation, its logic excited ridicule. Senator
Hale gave a not unfair synopsis: The President,
he said, declares: 1. That South Carolina
has just cause for seceding. 2. That she has no
right to secede. 3. That we have no right to prevent
her from seceding; and that the power of
the government is &quot;a power to do nothing at all.&quot;
Another wit said that Buchanan was willing to
give up a <i>part</i> of the Constitution, and, if necessary,
the <i>whole</i>, in order to preserve the <i>remainder</i>!
But while this message of Mr. Buchanan has
been bitterly denounced, and with entire justice,
from the hour of its transmission to the present
day, yet a palliating consideration ought to be
noted: he had little reason to believe that, if he
asserted the right and duty of forcible coercion,
he would find at his back the indispensable force,
moral and physical, of the people. Demoralization
at the North was widespread. After the lapse
of a few months this condition passed, and then
those who had been beneath its influence desired
to forget the humiliating fact, and hoped that
others might either forget or never know the
measure of their weakness. In order that they
might save their good names, it was natural that
they should seek to suppress all evidence which
had not already found its way upon the public
record; but enough remains to show how grievously
for a while the knees were weakened under many
who enjoy&mdash;and rightfully, by reason of the rest
of their lives&mdash;the reputation of stalwart patriots.
<!-- Image No 215 --><a name='Png215'></a><a name='Page191'></a><span class="pagenum">191</span>
For example, late in October, General Scott suggested
to the President a division of the country
into four separate confederacies, roughly outlining
their boundaries. Scott was a dull man, but he
was the head of the army and enjoyed a certain
prestige, so that it was impossible to say that his
notions, however foolish in themselves, were of no
consequence. But if the blunders of General Scott
could not fatally wound the Union cause, the blunders
of Horace Greeley might conceivably do so.
If there had been in the Northern States any newspaper&mdash;apart
from Mr. Garrison's &quot;Liberator&quot;&mdash;which
was thoroughly committed to the anti-slavery
cause, it was the New York &quot;Tribune,&quot;
under the guidance of that distinguished editor.
Republicans everywhere throughout the land had
been educated by his teachings, and had become
accustomed to take a large part of their knowledge
and their opinions in matters political from his
writings. It was a misfortune for Abraham Lincoln,
which cannot be overrated, that from the
moment of his nomination to the day of his death
the &quot;Tribune&quot; was largely engaged in criticising
his measures and in condemning his policy.</p>

<p>No sooner did all that, which Mr. Greeley had
been striving during many years to bring about,
seem to be on the point of consummation, than the
demoralized and panic-stricken reformer became
desirous to undo his own achievements, and to use
for the purpose of effecting a sudden retrogression
all the influence which he had gained by
<!-- Image No 216 --><a name='Png216'></a><a name='Page192'></a><span class="pagenum">192</span>
bold leadership. November 9, 1860, it was appalling
to read in the editorial columns of his sheet,
that &quot;if the Cotton States shall decide that they
can do better out of the Union than in it, we insist
on letting them go in peace;&quot; that, while the
&quot;Tribune&quot; denied the right of nullification, yet it
would admit that &quot;to withdraw from the Union
is quite another matter;&quot; that &quot;whenever a considerable
section of our Union shall deliberately
resolve to go out, we shall resist all coercive measures
designed to keep it in.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_117_119'></a><a href='#Footnote_117_119'><sup>[117]</sup></a>
 At the end of
another month the &quot;Tribune's&quot; famous editor was
still in the same frame of mind, declaring himself
&quot;averse to the employment of military force to
fasten one section of our confederacy to the other,&quot;
and saying that, &quot;if eight States, having five millions
of people, choose to separate from us, they
cannot be permanently withheld from so doing by
federal cannon.&quot; On December 17 he even said
that the South had as good a right to secede from
the Union as the colonies had to secede from
Great Britain, and that he &quot;would not stand up
for coercion, for subjugation,&quot; because he did not
&quot;think it would be just.&quot; On February 23, 1861,
he said that if the Cotton States, or the Gulf
States, &quot;choose to form an independent nation,
they have a clear moral right to do so,&quot; and if
<!-- Image No 217 --><a name='Png217'></a><a name='Page193'></a><span class="pagenum">193</span>
the &quot;great body of the Southern people&quot; become
alienated from the Union and wish to &quot;escape
from it, we will do our best to forward their
views.&quot; A volume could be filled with the like
writing of his prolific pen at this time, and every
sentence of such purport was the casting of a new
stone to create an almost impassable obstruction in
the path along which the new President must soon
endeavor to move. Thurlow Weed, editor of the
Albany &quot;Evening Journal,&quot; and the confidential
adviser of Seward, wrote in favor of concessions;
he declared that &quot;a victorious party can afford to
be tolerant;&quot; and he advocated a convention to
revise the Constitution, on the ground that, &quot;after
more than seventy years of wear and tear, of collision
and abrasion, it should be no cause of wonder
that the machinery of government is found
weakened, or out of repair, or even defective.&quot;
Frequently he uttered the wish, vague and of fine
sound, but enervating, that the Republicans might
&quot;meet secession as patriots and not as partisans.&quot;
On November 9 the Democratic New York &quot;Herald,&quot;
discussing the election of Lincoln, said:
&quot;For far less than this our fathers seceded from
Great Britain;&quot; it also declared coercion to be
&quot;out of the question,&quot; and laid down the principle
that each State possesses &quot;the right to break the
tie of the confederacy, as a nation might break a
treaty, and to repel coercion as a nation might
repel invasion.&quot;</p>

<p>Local elections in New York and Massachusetts
&quot;showed a striking and general reduction of Republican
<!-- Image No 218 --><a name='Png218'></a><a name='Page194'></a><span class="pagenum">194</span>
strength.&quot; In December the mayor of
Philadelphia, though that city had polled a heavy
Republican majority, told a mass meeting in Independence
Square that denunciations of slavery
were inconsistent with national brotherhood, and
&quot;must be frowned down by a just and law-abiding
people.&quot; The Bell and Everett men, generally,
desired peace at any price. The business men of
the North, alarmed at the prospect of disorder,
became loudly solicitous for concession, compromise,
even surrender.<a name='FNanchor_118_120'></a><a href='#Footnote_118_120'><sup>[118]</sup></a>
 In Democratic meetings a
threatening tone was adopted. One proposal was
to reconstruct the Union, leaving out the New
England States. So late even as January 21,
1861, before an immense and noteworthy gathering
in New York, an orator ventured to say: &quot;If
a revolution of force is to begin, it shall be inaugurated
at home;&quot; and the words were cheered.
The distinguished Chancellor Walworth said that
it would be &quot;as brutal to send men to butcher our
own brothers of the Southern States as it would be
to massacre them in the Northern States.&quot; When
DeWitt Clinton's son, George, spoke of secession
as &quot;rebellion,&quot; the multitude hailed the word with
cries of dissent. Even at Faneuil Hall, in Boston,
&quot;a very large and respectable meeting&quot; was emphatically
in favor of compromise. It was impossible
<!-- Image No 219 --><a name='Png219'></a><a name='Page195'></a><span class="pagenum">195</span>
to measure accurately the extent and force
of all this demoralization; but the symptoms were
that vast numbers were infected with such sentiments,
and that they would have been worse than
useless as backers of a vigorous policy on the part
of the government.</p>

<p>With the North wavering and ready to retreat,
and the South aggressive and confident, it was
exacting to expect Mr. Buchanan to stand up for
a fight. Why should he, with his old-time Democratic
principles, now by a firm, defiant attitude
precipitate a crisis, possibly a civil war, when
Horace Greeley and Wendell Phillips were conspicuously
running away from the consequences
of their own teachings, and were loudly crying
&quot;Peace! peace!&quot; after they themselves had long
been doing all in their power to bring the North
up to the fighting point? When these leaders
faced to the rear, it was hard to say who could
be counted upon to fill the front rank. In truth,
it was a situation which might have discouraged a
more combative patriot than Buchanan. Meanwhile,
while the Northerners talked chiefly of yielding,
the hot and florid rhetoric of the Southern orators,
often laden with contemptuous insult, smote
with disturbing menace upon the ears even of the
most courageous Unionists. It was said at the
South and feared at the North that secession had
a &quot;Spartan band in every Northern State,&quot; and
that blood would flow in Northern cities at least as
soon and as freely as on the Southern plantations,
<!-- Image No 220 --><a name='Png220'></a><a name='Page196'></a><span class="pagenum">196</span>
if forcible coercion should be attempted. Was it
possible to be sure that this was all rodomontade?
To many good citizens there seemed some reason
to think that the best hope for avoiding the fulfillment
at the North of these sanguinary threats
might lie in the probability that the anti-slavery
agitators would not stand up to encounter a genuinely
mortal peril.</p>

<p>When the Star of the West retired, a little
ignominiously, from her task of reinforcing Fort
Sumter, Senator Wigfall jeered insolently. &quot;Your
flag has been insulted,&quot; he said; &quot;redress it if you
dare! You have submitted to it for two months,
and you will submit forever.... We have dissolved
the Union; mend it if you can; cement it
with blood; try the experiment!&quot; Mr. Chestnut
of South Carolina wished to &quot;unfurl the Palmetto
flag, fling it to the breeze ... and ring the clarion
notes of defiance in the ears of an insolent foe.&quot;
Such bombastic but confident language, of which a
great quantity was uttered in this winter of 1860-61,
may exasperate or intimidate according to the
present temper of the opponent whose ear it assaults;
for a while the North was more in condition
to be awestruck than to be angered. Her
spokesmen failed to answer back, and left her to
listen not without anxiety to fierce predictions that
Southern flags would soon be floating over the
dome of the Capitol and even over Faneuil Hall,
if she should be so imprudent as to test Southern
valor and Southern resources.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 221 --><a name='Png221'></a><a name='Page197'></a><span class="pagenum">197</span>
Matters looked even worse for the Union cause
in Congress than in the country. Occasionally
some irritated Northern Republican shot out words
of spirit; but the prevalent desire was for conciliation,
compromise, and concession, while some actually
adopted secession doctrines. For example,
Daniel E. Sickles, in the House, threatened that
the secession of the Southern States should be followed
by that of New York city; and in fact the
scheme had been recommended by the Democratic
mayor, Fernando Wood, in a message to the Common
Council of the city on January 6; and General
Dix conceived it to be a possibility. In the
Senate Simon Cameron declared himself desirous
to preserve the Union &quot;by any sacrifice of feeling,
and I may say of principle.&quot; A sacrifice of political
principle by Cameron was not, perhaps, a serious
matter; but he intended the phrase to be emphatic,
and he was a leading Republican politician, had
been a candidate for the presidential nomination,
and was dictator in Pennsylvania. Even Seward,
in the better days of the middle of January, felt
that he could &quot;afford to meet prejudice with conciliation,
exaction with concession which surrenders
no principle, and violence with the right hand of
peace;&quot; and he was &quot;willing, after the excitement
of rebellion and secession should have passed away,
to call a convention for amending the Constitution.&quot;</p>

<p>This message of Buchanan marked the lowest
point to which the temperature of his patriotism
<!-- Image No 222 --><a name='Png222'></a><a name='Page198'></a><span class="pagenum">198</span>
fell. Soon afterward, stimulated by heat applied
from outside, it began to rise. The first intimation
which impressed upon his anxious mind that
he was being too acquiescent towards the South
came from General Cass. That steadfast Democrat,
of the old Jacksonian school, like many of
his party at the North, was fully as good a patriot
and Union man as most of the Republicans were
approving themselves to be during these winter
months of vacillation, alarm, and compromise. In
November he was strenuously in favor of forcibly
coercing a seceding State, but later assented to
the tenor of Mr. Buchanan's message. The frame
of mind which induced this assent, however, was
transitory; for immediately he began to insist upon
the reinforcement of the garrisons of the Southern
forts, and on December 13 he resigned because the
President refused to accede to his views. A few
days earlier Howell Cobb had had the grace to
resign from the Treasury, which he left entirely
empty. In the reorganization Philip F. Thomas
of Maryland, a Secessionist also, succeeded Cobb;
Judge Black was moved into the State Department;
and Edwin M. Stanton of Pennsylvania
followed Black as attorney-general. Mr. Floyd,
than whom no Secessionist has left a name in worse
odor at the North, had at first advised against any
&quot;rash movement&quot; in the way of secession, on the
ground that Mr. Lincoln's administration would
&quot;fail, and be regarded as impotent for good or
evil, within four months after his inauguration.&quot;
<!-- Image No 223 --><a name='Png223'></a><a name='Page199'></a><span class="pagenum">199</span>
None the less he had long been using his official
position in the War Department to send arms into
the Southern States, and to make all possible arrangements
for putting them in an advantageous
position for hostilities. Fortunately about this
time the famous defalcation in the Indian Department,
in which he was guiltily involved, destroyed
his credit with the President, and at the same time
he quarreled with his associates concerning Anderson's
removal to Fort Sumter. On December 29
he resigned, and the duties of his place were laid
for a while upon Judge Holt, the postmaster-general.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, December 30, there was
what has been properly called a cabinet crisis.
The South Carolina commissioners, just arrived in
Washington, were demanding recognition, and to
treat with the government as if they were representatives
of a foreign power. The President declined
to receive them in a diplomatic character,
but offered to act as go-between betwixt them and
Congress. The President's advisers, however, were
in a far less amiable frame of mind, for their blood
had been stirred wholesomely by the secession of
South Carolina and the presence of these emissaries
with their insolent demands. Mr. Black, now at
the head of the State Department, had gone through
much the same phases of feeling as General Cass.
In November he had been &quot;emphatic in his advocacy
of coercion,&quot; but afterward had approved the
President's message and even declared forcible
<!-- Image No 224 --><a name='Png224'></a><a name='Page200'></a><span class="pagenum">200</span>
coercion to be &quot;<i>ipso facto</i> an expulsion&quot; of the
State from the Union; since then he had drifted
back and made fast at his earlier moorings. On
this important Sunday morning Mr. Buchanan
learned with dismay that either his reply to the
South Carolinians must be substantially modified,
or Mr. Black and Mr. Stanton would retire from
the cabinet. Under this pressure he yielded. Mr.
Black drafted a new reply to the commissioners,
Mr. Stanton copied it, Holt concurred in it, and,
in substance, Mr. Buchanan accepted it. This
affair constituted, as Messrs. Nicolay and Hay
well say, &quot;the President's virtual abdication,&quot; and
thereafterward began the &quot;cabinet r&eacute;gime.&quot; Upon
the commissioners this chill gust from the North
struck so disagreeably that, on January 2, they
hastened home to their &quot;independent nation.&quot;
From this time forth the South covered Mr. Buchanan
with contumely and abuse; Mr. Benjamin
called him &quot;a senile executive, under the sinister
influence of insane counsels;&quot; and the poor old
man, really wishing to do right, but stripped of
friends and of his familiar advisers, and confounded
by the views of new counselors, presented a spectacle
for pity.</p>

<p>On January 8 Mr. Thompson, secretary of the
interior, resigned, and the vacancy was left unfilled.
A more important change took place on the following
day, when Mr. Thomas left the Treasury
Department, and the New York bankers, whose aid
was essential, forced the President, sorely against
<!-- Image No 225 --><a name='Png225'></a><a name='Page201'></a><span class="pagenum">201</span>
his will, to give the place to General John A. Dix.
This proved an excellent appointment. General
Dix was an old Democrat, but of the high-spirited
type; he could have tolerated secession by peaceable
agreement, but rose in anger at menaces
against the flag and the Union. He conducted his
department with entire success, and also rendered
to the country perhaps the greatest service that
was done by any man during that winter. On
January 29 he sent the telegram which closed with
the famous words: &quot;If any one attempts to haul
down the American flag, shoot him on the spot.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_119_121'></a><a href='#Footnote_119_121'><sup>[119]</sup></a>

This rung out as the first cheering, stimulating
indication of a fighting temper at the North. It
was a tonic which came at a time of sore need, and
for too long a while it remained the solitary dose!</p>

<p>So much of the President's message as concerned
the condition of the country was referred in the
House to a Committee of Thirty-three, composed
by appointing one member from each State. Other
resolutions and motions upon the same subject, to
the number of twenty-five, were also sent to this
committee. It had many sessions from December
11 to January 14, but never made an approach
to evolving anything distantly approaching agreement.
When, on January 14, the report came, it
was an absurd fiasco: it contained six propositions,
of which each had the assent of a majority
of a quorum; but seven minority reports, bearing
<!-- Image No 226 --><a name='Png226'></a><a name='Page202'></a><span class="pagenum">202</span>
together the signatures of fourteen members, were
also submitted; and the members of the seceding
States refused to act. The only actual fruit was a
proposed amendment to the Constitution: &quot;That
no amendment shall be made to the Constitution
which will authorize or give to Congress the
power to abolish or interfere, within any State,
with the domestic institutions thereof, including
that of persons held to labor or service by the
laws of said State.&quot; In the expiring hours of
the Thirty-sixth Congress this was passed by the
House, and then by the Senate, and was signed by
the President. Lincoln, in his inaugural address,
said of it: &quot;Holding such a provision to be now
constitutional law, I have no objection to its being
made express and irrevocable.&quot; This view of it
was correct; it had no real significance, and the
ill-written sentence never disfigured the Constitution;
it simply sank out of sight, forgotten by
every one.</p>

<p>Collaterally with the sitting of this House committee,
a Committee of Thirteen was appointed in
the Senate. To these gentlemen also &quot;a string of
Union-saving devices&quot; was presented, but on the
last day of the year they reported that they had
&quot;not been able to agree upon any general plan of
adjustment.&quot;</p>

<p>The earnest effort of the venerable Crittenden
to Affect a compromise aroused a faint hope. But
he offered little else than an extension westward
of the Missouri Compromise line; and he never
<!-- Image No 227 --><a name='Png227'></a><a name='Page203'></a><span class="pagenum">203</span>
really had the slightest chance of effecting that
consummation, which in fact <i>could not be</i> effected.
His plan was finally defeated on the last evening
of the session.</p>

<p>Collaterally with these congressional debates
there were also proceeding in Washington the sessions
of the Peace Congress, another futile effort
to concoct a cure for an incurable condition. It
met on February 4, 1861, but only twenty-one
States out of thirty-four were represented. The
seven States which had seceded said that they
could not come, being &quot;Foreign Nations.&quot; Six
other States<a name='FNanchor_120_122'></a><a href='#Footnote_120_122'><sup>[120]</sup></a>
 held aloof. Those Northern States
which sent delegates selected &quot;their most conservative
and compromising men,&quot; and so great
a tendency towards concession was shown that
Unionists soon condemned the scheme as merely a
deceitful cover devised by the Southerners behind
which they could the more securely carry on their
processes of secession. These gentlemen talked a
great deal and finally presented a report or plan to
Congress five days before the end of the session;
the House refused to receive it, the Senate rejected
it by 7 ayes to 28 nays. The only usefulness of
the gathering was as evidence of the unwillingness
of the South to compromise. In fact the Southern
leaders were entirely frank and outspoken in
acknowledging their position; they had said, from
the beginning, that they did not wish the Committee
of Thirty-three to accomplish anything; and
<!-- Image No 228 --><a name='Png228'></a><a name='Page204'></a><span class="pagenum">204</span>
they had endeavored to dissuade Southerners from
accepting positions upon it. Hawkins of Florida
said that &quot;the time of compromise had passed forever.&quot;
South Carolina refused to share in the
Peace Congress, because she did &quot;not deem it
advisable to initiate negotiations when she had no
desire or intention to promote the object in view.&quot;
Governor Peters of Mississippi, in poetic language,
suggested another difficulty: &quot;When sparks cease
to fly upwards,&quot; he said, &quot;Comanches respect treaties,
and wolves kill sheep no more, the oath of a
Black Republican might be of some value as a
protection to slave property.&quot; Jefferson Davis
contemptuously stigmatized all the schemes of compromise
as &quot;quack nostrums,&quot; and he sneered
justly enough at those who spun fine arguments
of legal texture, and consumed time &quot;discussing
abstract questions, reading patchwork from the
opinions of men now mingled with the dust.&quot;</p>

<p>It is not known by what logic gentlemen who
held these views defended their conduct in retaining
their positions in the government of the nation
for the purpose of destroying it. Senator Yulee
of Florida shamelessly gave his motive for staying
in the Senate: &quot;It is thought we can keep the
hands of Mr. Buchanan tied and disable the Republicans
from effecting any legislation which will
strengthen the hands of the incoming administration.&quot;
Mr. Toombs of Georgia, speaking and
voting at his desk in the Senate, declared himself
&quot;as good a rebel and as good a traitor as ever
<!-- Image No 229 --><a name='Png229'></a><a name='Page205'></a><span class="pagenum">205</span>
descended from Revolutionary loins,&quot; and said
that the Union was already dissolved,&mdash;by which
assertion he made his position in the Senate absolutely
indefensible. The South Carolina senators
resigned before their State ordained itself a &quot;foreign
nation,&quot; and incurred censure for being so
&quot;precipitate.&quot; In a word, the general desire was
to remain in office, hampering and obstructing the
government, until March 4, 1861, and at a caucus
of disunionists it was agreed to do so. But the
pace became too rapid, and resignations followed
pretty close upon the formal acts of secession.</p>

<p>On the same day on which the Peace Congress
opened its sessions in Washington, there came together
at Montgomery, in Alabama, delegates from
six States for the purpose of forming a Southern
Confederacy. On the third day thereafter a plan
for a provisional government, substantially identical
with the Constitution of the United States, was
adopted. On February 9 the oath of allegiance
was taken, and Jefferson Davis and Alexander H.
Stephens were elected respectively President and
Vice-President. On February 13 the military and
naval committees were directed to report plans
for organizing an army and navy. Mr. Davis
promptly journeyed to Montgomery, making on
the way many speeches, in which he told his
hearers that no plan for a reconstruction of the
old Union would be entertained; and promised
that those who should interfere with the new nation
would have to &quot;smell Southern powder and
<!-- Image No 230 --><a name='Png230'></a><a name='Page206'></a><span class="pagenum">206</span>
to feel Southern steel.&quot; On February 18 he was
inaugurated, and in his address again referred to
the &quot;arbitrament of the sword.&quot; Immediately
afterward he announced his cabinet as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="display">
<p>
Robert Toombs of Georgia, secretary of state.<br />
C.G. Memminger of South Carolina, secretary of the treasury.<br />
L.P. Walker of Alabama, secretary of war.<br />

J.H. Reagan of Texas, postmaster-general.<br />
Judah P. Benjamin of Louisiana, attorney-general.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>On March 11 the permanent Constitution was
adopted.<a name='FNanchor_121_123'></a><a href='#Footnote_121_123'><sup>[121]</sup></a>
 Thus the machine of the new government
was set in working order. Mr. Greeley gives

numerical strength of the sections of the country

<p>The disproportion would have discouraged the
fathers of the new nation, if they had anticipated
that the North would be resolute in using its overwhelming
resources. But how could they believe
that this would be the case when they read the
New York &quot;Tribune&quot; and the reports of Mr.
Phillips's harangues?</p>

<hr class='short'/>

<p>On February 13 the electoral vote was to be
counted in Congress. Rumors were abroad that
the Secessionists intended to interfere with this by
tumults and violence; but the evidence is insufficient
to prove that any such scheme was definitely
matured; it was talked of, but ultimately it seems
to have been laid aside with a view to action at a
later date. Naturally enough, however, the country
was disquieted. In the emergency the action
of General Scott was watched with deep anxiety.
A Southerner by birth and by social sympathies,
he had been expected by the Secessionists to join
their movement. But the old soldier&mdash;though
broken by age and infirmities, and though he had
proposed the folly of voluntarily quartering the
country, like the corpse of a traitor&mdash;had his patriotism
and his temper at once aroused when violence
was threatened. On and after October 29
he had repeatedly advised reinforcement of the
Southern garrisons; though it must be admitted,
in Buchanan's behalf, that the general made no
suggestion as to how or where the troops could be
obtained for this purpose. In the same spirit he
<!-- Image No 234 --><a name='Png234'></a><a name='Page208'></a><span class="pagenum">208</span>
now said, with stern resolution, that there should
be ample military preparations to insure both the
count and the inauguration; and he told some of
the Southerners that he would blow traitors to
pieces at the cannon's mouth without hesitation.
Disturbed at his vehemence, they denounced him
bitterly, and sent him frequent notices of assassination.
Floyd distributed orders concerning
troops and munitions directly from the War Department,
and carefully concealed them from the
general who was the head of the army. But
secrecy and intimidation were in vain. The aged
warrior was fiercely in earnest; if there was going
to be any outbreak in Washington he was
going to put it down with bullets and bayonets,
and he gathered his soldiers and instructed his
officers accordingly. But happily the preparation
of these things was sufficient to render the use of
them unnecessary. When the day came Vice-President
Breckenridge performed his duty, however
unwelcome, without flinching. He presided
over the joint session and conducted the count
with the air of a man determined to enforce law
and order, and at the close declared the election of
Abraham Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin.</p>

<p>Still only the smaller crisis had been passed.
Much more alarming stories now flew from mouth
to mouth,&mdash;of plots to seize the capital and to
prevent the inauguration, even to assassinate Lincoln
on his journey to Washington. How much
foundation there was for these is not accurately
<!-- Image No 235 --><a name='Png235'></a><a name='Page209'></a><span class="pagenum">209</span>
known. That the idea of capturing Washington
had fascinated the Southern fancy is certain. &quot;I
see no reason,&quot; said Senator Iverson, &quot;why Washington
city should not be continued the capital
of the Southern Confederacy.&quot; The Richmond
&quot;Examiner&quot; railed grossly: &quot;That filthy cage of
unclean birds must and will assuredly be purified
by fire.... Our people can take it,&mdash;they will
take it.... Scott, the arch-traitor, and Lincoln,
the beast, combined, cannot prevent it. The 'Illinois
Ape' must retrace his journey more rapidly
than he came.&quot; The abundant talk of this sort
created uneasiness; and Judge Holt said that
there was cause for alarm. But a committee of
Congress reported that, though it was difficult to
speak positively, yet they found no evidence sufficient
to prove &quot;the existence of a secret organization.&quot;
Alexander H. Stephens has denied that
there was any intention to attack the city, and
probably the notion of seizure did not pass beyond
the stage of talk.</p>

<p>But the alleged plot to assassinate Mr. Lincoln
was more definite. He had been spending the
winter quietly in Springfield, where he had been
overrun by visitors, who wished to look at him,
to advise him, and to secure promises of office;
fortunately the tedious procession had lost part of
its offensiveness by touching his sense of humor.
Anxious people made well-meaning but useless
efforts to induce him to say something for effect
upon the popular mind; but he resolutely and
<!-- Image No 236 --><a name='Png236'></a><a name='Page210'></a><span class="pagenum">210</span>
wisely maintained silence. His position and opinions,
he said, had already been declared in his
speeches with all the clearness he could give to
them, and the people had appeared to understand
and approve them. He could not improve and did
not desire to change these utterances. Occasionally
he privately expressed his dislike to the conceding
and compromising temper which threatened
to undo, for an indefinite future, all which the
long and weary struggle of anti-slavery men had
accomplished. In this line he wrote a letter of
protest to Greeley, which inspired that gentleman
to a singular expression of sympathy; let the
Union go to pieces, exclaimed the emotional editor,
let presidents be assassinated, let the Republican
party suffer crushing defeat, but let there not be
&quot;another nasty compromise.&quot; To Mr. Kellogg, the
Illinoisian on the House Committee of Thirty-three,
Lincoln wrote: &quot;Entertain no proposition for a
compromise in regard to the extension of slavery.
The instant you do, they have us under again; all
our labor is lost, and sooner or later must be done
over again.&quot; He repeated almost the same words
to E.B. Washburne, a member of the House.
Duff Green tried hard to get something out of
him for the comfort of Mr. Buchanan, but failed
to extort more than commonplace generalities.
To Seward he wrote that he did not wish to interfere
with the present status, or to meddle with
slavery as it now lawfully existed. To like purport
he wrote to Alexander H. Stephens, induced
<!-- Image No 237 --><a name='Png237'></a><a name='Page211'></a><span class="pagenum">211</span>
thereto by the famous Union speech of that gentleman.
He eschewed hostile feeling, saying: &quot;I
never have been, am not now, and probably never
shall be, in a mood of harassing the people, either
North or South.&quot; Nevertheless, while he said that
all were &quot;brothers of a common country,&quot; he was
perfectly resolved that the country should remain
&quot;common,&quot; even if the bond of brotherhood had
to be riveted by force. He admitted that this
necessity would be &quot;an ugly point;&quot; but he was
perfectly clear that &quot;the right of a State to secede
is not an open or debatable question.&quot; He desired
that General Scott should be prepared either
to &quot;hold or retake&quot; the Southern forts, if need
should be, at or after the inauguration; but on
his journey to Washington he said to many audiences
that he wished no war and no bloodshed,
and that these evils could be avoided if people
would only &quot;keep cool&quot; and &quot;keep their temper,
on both sides of the line.&quot;</p>

<p>On Monday, February 11, 1861, Mr. Lincoln
spoke to his fellow citizens of Springfield a very
brief farewell, so solemn as to sound ominous in
the ears of those who know what afterward occurred.
It was arranged that he should stop at
various points upon the somewhat circuitous route
which had been laid out, and that he should arrive
in Washington on Saturday, February 23. The
programme, was pursued accurately till near the
close; he made, of course, many speeches, but none
added anything to what was already known as to
his views.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 238 --><a name='Png238'></a><a name='Page212'></a><span class="pagenum">212</span>
Meantime the thick rumors of violence were
bringing much uneasiness to persons who were
under responsibilities. Baltimore was the place
where, and its villainous &quot;Plug Uglies&quot; were the
persons by whom, the plot, if there was one, was
to be executed. Mr. Felton, president of the
Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad
Company, engaged Allan Pinkerton to explore the
matter, and the report of this skillful detective
indicated a probability of an attack with the purpose
of assassination. At that time the cars were
drawn by horses across town from the northern to
the southern station, and during the passage an
assault could be made with ease and with great
chance of success. As yet there was no indication
that the authorities intended to make, even if they
could make,<a name='FNanchor_124_126'></a><a href='#Footnote_124_126'><sup>[124]</sup></a>
 any adequate arrangements for the
protection of the traveler. At Philadelphia Mr.
Lincoln was told of the fears of his friends, and
talked with Mr. Pinkerton, but he refused to change
his plan. On February 22 he was to assist at a
flag-raising in Philadelphia, and was then to go on
to Harrisburg, and on the following day he was to
go from there to Baltimore. He declined to alter
either route or hours.</p>

<p>But other persons besides Mr. Felton had been
busy with independent detective investigations, the
result of which was in full accord with the report
of Mr. Pinkerton. On February 22 Mr. Frederick
<!-- Image No 239 --><a name='Png239'></a><a name='Page213'></a><span class="pagenum">213</span>
W. Seward, sent by his father and General Scott,
both then at Washington, delivered to Mr. Lincoln,
at Philadelphia, the message that there was
&quot;serious danger&quot; to his life if the time of his
passage through Baltimore should be known. Yet
Lincoln still remained obdurate. He declared that
if an escorting delegation from Baltimore should
meet him at Harrisburg, he would go on with it.
But at Harrisburg no such escort presented itself.
Then the few who knew the situation discussed
further as to what should be done, Norman B.
Judd being chief spokesman for evading the danger
by a change of programme. Naturally the
objection of seeming timid and of exciting ridicule
was present in the minds of all, and it was put
somewhat emphatically by Colonel Sumner. Mr.
Lincoln at last settled the dispute; he said: &quot;I
have thought over this matter considerably since
I went over the ground with Pinkerton last night.
The appearance of Mr. Frederick Seward, with
warning from another source, confirms Mr. Pinkerton's
belief. Unless there are some other reasons
besides fear of ridicule, I am disposed to
carry out Judd's plan.&quot;</p>

<p>This plan was accordingly carried out with the
success which its simplicity insured. Mr. Lincoln
and his stalwart friend, Colonel Lamon, slipped
out of a side door to a hackney carriage, were
driven to the railway station, and returned by the
train to Philadelphia. Their departure was not
noticed, but had it been, news of it could not
<!-- Image No 240 --><a name='Png240'></a><a name='Page214'></a><span class="pagenum">214</span>
have been sent away, for Mr. Felton had had the
telegraph wires secretly cut outside the town. He
also ordered, upon a plausible pretext, that the
southward-bound night train on his road should
be held back until the arrival of this train from
Harrisburg. Mr. Lincoln and Colonel Lamon
passed from the one train to the other without
recognition, and rolled into Washington early on
the following morning. Mr. Seward and Mr.
Washburne met Lincoln at the station and went
with him to Willard's Hotel. Soon afterward the
country was astonished, and perhaps some persons
were discomfited, as the telegraph carried abroad
the news of his arrival.</p>

<p>Those who were disappointed at this safe conclusion
of his journey, if in fact there were any such,
together with many who would have contemned
assassination, at once showered upon him sneers
and ridicule. They said that Lincoln had put on
a disguise and had shown the white feather, when
there had been no real danger. But this was not
just. Whether or not there was the completed
machinery of a definite, organized plot for assault
and assassination is uncertain; that is to say, this
is not <i>proved</i>; yet the evidence is so strong that
the majority of investigators seem to agree in the
opinion that <i>probably</i> there was a plan thoroughly
concerted and ready for execution. Even if there
was not, it was very likely that a riot might be
suddenly started, which would be as fatal in its
consequences as a premeditated scheme. But, after
<!-- Image No 241 --><a name='Png241'></a><a name='Page215'></a><span class="pagenum">215</span>
all, the question of the plot is one of mere curiosity
and quite aside from the true issue. That issue,
so far as it presented itself for determination by
Mr. Lincoln, was simply whether a case of such
probability of danger was made out that as a prudent
man he should overrule the only real objection,&mdash;that
of exciting ridicule,&mdash;and avoid a
peril which the best judges believed to exist, and
which, if it did exist, involved consequences of immeasurable
seriousness not only to himself but to
the nation. For a wise man only one conclusion
was possible. The story of the disguise was a silly
slander, based upon the trifling fact that for this
night journey Lincoln wore a traveling cap instead
of his hat.</p>

<p>Lincoln's own opinion as to the danger is not
quite clear.<a name='FNanchor_125_127'></a><a href='#Footnote_125_127'><sup>[125]</sup></a>
 He said to Mr. Lossing that, after
hearing Mr. Seward, he believed &quot;such a plot to
be in existence.&quot; But he also said: &quot;I did not
then, nor do I now, believe I should have been
assassinated, had I gone through Baltimore as first
contemplated; but I thought it wise to run no
risk, where no risk was necessary.&quot;</p>

<p>The reflection can hardly fail to occur, how
grossly unfair it was that Mr. Lincoln should be
put into the position in which he was put at this
time, and then that fault should be found with him
even if his prudence was overstrained. Many millions
<!-- Image No 242 --><a name='Png242'></a><a name='Page216'></a><span class="pagenum">216</span>
of people in the country hated him with a
hatred unutterable; among them might well be
many fanatics, to whom assassination would seem
a noble act, many desperadoes who would regard it
as a pleasing excitement; and he was to go through
a city which men of this stamp could at any time
dominate. The custom of the country compelled
this man, whom it had long since selected as its
ruler, to make a journey of extreme danger without
any species of protection whatsoever. So far
as peril went, no other individual in the United
States had ever, presumably, been in a peril like
that which beset him; so far as safeguards went,
he had no more than any other traveler. A few
friends volunteered to make the journey with him,
but they were useless as guardians; and he and
they were so hustled and jammed in the railway
stations that one of them actually had his arm
broken. This extraordinary spectacle may have
indicated folly on the part of the nation which
permitted it, but certainly it did not involve the
disgrace of the individual who had no choice about
it. The people put Mr. Lincoln in a position in
which he was subjected to the most appalling, as it
is the most vague, of all dangers, and then left him
to take care of himself as best he could. It was
ungenerous afterward to criticise him for exercising
prudence in the performance of that duty
which he ought never to have been called upon to
perform at all.<a name='FNanchor_126_128'></a><a href='#Footnote_126_128'><sup>[126]</sup></a>

Immediately after his arrival in Washington
Mr. Lincoln received a visit from the members of
the Peace Congress. Grotesque and ridiculous
<!-- Image No 244 --><a name='Png244'></a><a name='Page218'></a><span class="pagenum">218</span>
descriptions of him, as if he had been a Caliban
in education, manners, and aspect, had been rife
among Southerners, and the story goes that the
Southern delegates expected to be at once amused
and shocked by the sight of a clodhopper whose
conversation would be redolent of the barnyard,
not to say of the pigsty. Those of them who had
any skill in reading character were surprised,&mdash;
as the tradition is,&mdash;discomfited, even a little
alarmed, at what in fact they beheld; for Mr. Lincoln
appeared before them a self-possessed man,
expressing to them such clear convictions and such
a distinct and firm purpose as compelled them into
<!-- Image No 245 --><a name='Png245'></a><a name='Page219'></a><span class="pagenum">219</span>
new notions of his capacity and told them of much
trouble ahead. His remark to Mr. Rives, coming
from one who spoke accurately, had an ominous
sound in rebellious ears: &quot;My course is as plain
as a turnpike road. It is marked out by the Constitution.
I am in no doubt which way to go.&quot;
The wiser Southerners withdrew from this reception
quite sober and thoughtful, with some new
ideas about the man with whom their relationship
seemed on the verge of becoming hostile. After
abundant allowance is made for the enthusiasm of
Northern admirers, it remains certain that Lincoln
bore well this severe ordeal of criticism on the part
of those who would have been glad to despise him.
Ungainly they saw him, but not undignified, and
the strange impressive sadness seldom dwelt so
strikingly upon his face as at this time, as though
all the weight of misery, which the millions of his
fellow citizens were to endure throughout the coming
years, already burdened the soul of the ruler
who had been chosen to play the most responsible
part in the crisis and the anguish.</p>

<p>March 4, 1861, inauguration day, was fine and
sunny. If there had ever been any real danger
of trouble, the fear of it had almost entirely subsided.
Northerners and Southerners had found
out in good season that General Scott was not in
a temporizing mood; he had in the city two batteries,
a few companies of regulars,&mdash;653 men,
exclusive of some marines,&mdash;and the corps of
picked Washington Volunteers. He said that this
<!-- Image No 246 --><a name='Png246'></a><a name='Page220'></a><span class="pagenum">220</span>
force was all he wanted. President Buchanan left
the White House in an open carriage, escorted by
a company of sappers and miners under Captain
Duane. At Willard's Hotel Mr. Lincoln entered
the carriage, and the two gentlemen passed along
the avenue, through crowds which cheered but
made no disturbance, to the Capitol. General
Scott with his regulars marched, &quot;flanking the
movement, in parallel streets.&quot; His two batteries,
while not made unpleasantly conspicuous, yet controlled
the plateau which extends before the east
front of the Capitol. Mr. Lincoln was simply
introduced by Senator Baker of Oregon, and delivered
his inaugural address. His voice had great
carrying capacity, and the vast crowd heard with
ease a speech of which every sentence was fraught
with an importance and scrutinized with an anxiety
far beyond that of any other speech ever delivered
in the United States. At its close the venerable
Chief Justice Taney administered the oath of office,
thereby informally but effectually reversing
the most famous opinion delivered by him during
his long incumbency in his high office.</p>

<p>The inaugural address was simple, earnest, and
direct, unincumbered by that rhetorical ornamentation
which the American people have always
admired as the highest form of eloquence. Those
Northerners who had expected magniloquent periods
and exaggerated outbursts of patriotism were
disappointed; and as they listened in vain for the
scream of the eagle, many grumbled at the absence
<!-- Image No 247 --><a name='Png247'></a><a name='Page221'></a><span class="pagenum">221</span>
of what they conceived to be <i>force</i>. Yet the general
feeling was of satisfaction, which grew as the
address was more thoroughly studied. The Southerners,
upon their part, looking anxiously to see
whether or not they must fight for their purpose,
construed the words of the new President correctly.
They heard him say: &quot;The union of these
States is perpetual.&quot; &quot;No State upon its own
mere motion can lawfully get out of the Union.&quot;
&quot;I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly
enjoins upon me, that the laws of the
Union be faithfully executed in all the States.&quot;
He also declared his purpose &quot;to hold, occupy, and
possess the property and places belonging to the
government, and to collect the duties and imposts.&quot;
These sentences made up the issue directly with
secession, and the South, reading them, knew that,
if the North was ready to back the President, war
was inevitable; none the less so because Mr. Lincoln
closed with patriotic and generous words:
&quot;We are not enemies, but friends. We must not
be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it
must not break our bonds of affection.&quot;</p>

<p>Until after the election of Mr. Lincoln in November,
1860, the sole issue between the North and
the South, between Republicans on the one hand
and Democrats and Compromisers on the other,
had related to slavery. Logically, the position of
the Republicans was impregnable. Their platforms
and their leaders agreed that the party
intended strictly to respect the Constitution, and
<!-- Image No 248 --><a name='Png248'></a><a name='Page222'></a><span class="pagenum">222</span>
not to interfere at all with slavery in the States
within which it now lawfully existed. They said
with truth that they had in no case deprived the
slaveholding communities of their rights, and they
denied the truth of the charge that they cherished
an inchoate design to interfere with those rights;
adding very truly that, at worst, a mere design,
which did not find expression in an overt act, could
give no right of action to the South. Mr. Lincoln
had been most explicit in declaring that the opposition
to slavery was not to go beyond efforts
to prevent its <i>extension</i>, which efforts would be
wholly within the Constitution and the law. He
repeated these things in his inaugural.</p>

<p>But while these incontrovertible allegations gave
the Republicans a logical advantage of which they
properly made the most, the South claimed a right
to make other collateral and equally undeniable
facts the ground of action. The only public matter
in connection with which Mr. Lincoln had won
any reputation was that of slavery. No one could
deny that he had been elected because the Republican
party had been pleased with his expression
of opinion on this subject. Now his most pointed
and frequently reiterated expression of that opinion
was that slavery was a &quot;moral, social, and political
evil;&quot; and this language was a fair equivalent
of the statement of the Republican platform of
1856, classing Slavery and Mormonism together,
as &quot;twin relics of barbarism.&quot; That the North
was willing, or would long be willing, to remain in
<!-- Image No 249 --><a name='Png249'></a><a name='Page223'></a><span class="pagenum">223</span>
amicable social and political bonds with a moral,
social, and political evil, and a relic of barbarism,
was intrinsically improbable, and was made more
improbable by the symptoms of the times.<a name='FNanchor_127_129'></a><a href='#Footnote_127_129'><sup>[127]</sup></a>
 Indeed,
Mr. Seward had said, in famous words, that
his section would not play this unworthy part; he
had proclaimed already the existence of an &quot;irrepressible
conflict;&quot; and therefore the South had
the word of the Republican leader that, in spite of
the Republican respect for the law, an anti-slavery
crusade was already in existence. The Southern
chiefs distinctly recognized and accepted this situation.<a name='FNanchor_128_130'></a><a href='#Footnote_128_130'><sup>[128]</sup></a>

There was an avowed Northern condemnation
<!-- Image No 250 --><a name='Png250'></a><a name='Page224'></a><span class="pagenum">224</span>
of their institution; there was an acknowledged
&quot;conflict.&quot; Such being the case, it was the
opinion of the chief men at the South that the
position taken by the North, of strict performance
of clear constitutional duties concerning an odious
institution, would not suffice for the safe perpetuation
of that institution.<a name='FNanchor_129_131'></a><a href='#Footnote_129_131'><sup>[129]</sup></a>
 This, their judgment,
appeared to be in a certain way also the judgment
of Mr. Lincoln; for he also conceived that to put
slavery where the &quot;fathers&quot; had left it was to
put it &quot;in the way of ultimate extinction;&quot; and
he had, in the most famous utterance of his life,
given his forecast of the future to the effect that
the country would in time be &quot;all free.&quot; The
only logical deduction was that he, and the Republican
party which had agreed with him sufficiently
to make him president, believed that the South
had no lawful recourse by which this result, however
unwelcome or ruinous, could in the long run
and the fullness of time be escaped. Under such
circumstances Southern political leaders now decided
that the time for separation had come. In
speaking of their scheme they called it &quot;secession,&quot;
and said that secession was a lawful act because
the Constitution was a compact revocable by any
of the parties. They might have called it &quot;revolution,&quot;<a name='FNanchor_130_132'></a><a href='#Footnote_130_132'><sup>[130]</sup></a>
<!-- Image No 251 --><a name='Png251'></a><a name='Page225'></a><span class="pagenum">225</span>
and have defended it upon the general
right of any large body of people, dissatisfied with
the government under which they find themselves,
to cast it off. But, if the step was <i>revolution</i>,
then the burden of proof was upon them; whereas
they said that <i>secession</i> was their lawful right,
without any regard whatsoever to the motive which
induced them to exercise it.<a name='FNanchor_131_133'></a><a href='#Footnote_131_133'><sup>[131]</sup></a>
 Such was the character
of the issue between the North and the South
prior to the first ordinance of secession. The
action of South Carolina, followed by the other
Gulf States, at once changed that issue, shifting
it from pro-slavery versus anti-slavery to union
versus disunion. This alteration quickly compelled
great numbers of men, both at the North and at
the South, to reconsider and, upon a new issue, to
place themselves also anew.</p>

<p>It has been said by all writers that in the seven
seceding States there was, in the four months following
the election, a very large proportion of
&quot;Union men.&quot; The name only signified that
these men did not think that the present inducements
to disunion were sufficient to render it a wise
measure. It did not signify that they thought
disunion unlawful, unconstitutional, and treasonable.
When, however, state conventions decided
the question of advisability against their opinions,
and they had to choose between allegiance to the
State and allegiance to the Union, they immediately
<!-- Image No 252 --><a name='Png252'></a><a name='Page226'></a><span class="pagenum">226</span>
adhered to the State, and this none the less
because they feared that she had taken an ill-advised
step. That is to say, at the South a &quot;Union
man&quot; <i>wished</i> to preserve the Union, whereas at
the North a &quot;Union man&quot; recognized a supreme
<i>obligation</i> to do so.</p>

<p>While the South, by political alchemy, was becoming
solidified and homogeneous, a corresponding
change was going on at the North. In that
section the great numbers&mdash;of whom some would
have re-made the Constitution, others would have
agreed to peaceable separation, and still others
would have made any concession to retain the integrity
of the Union&mdash;now saw that these were
indeed, as Jefferson Davis had said, &quot;quack
nostrums,&quot; and that the choice lay between permitting
a secession accompanied with insulting
menaces and some degree of actual violence, and
maintaining the Union by coercion. In this dilemma
great multitudes of Northern Democrats,
whose consciences had never been in the least disturbed
by the existence of slavery in the country
or even by efforts to extend it, became &quot;Union
men&quot; in the Northern sense of the word, which
made it about equivalent to coercionists. Their
simple creed was the integrity and perpetuity of
the nation.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln showed in his inaugural his accurate
appreciation of the new situation. Owing
all that he had become in the world to a few
anti-slavery speeches, elevated to the presidency
<!-- Image No 253 --><a name='Png253'></a><a name='Page227'></a><span class="pagenum">227</span>
by votes which really meant little else than hostility
to slavery, what was more natural than that
he should at this moment revert to this great topic
and make the old dispute the main part and real
substance of his address? But this fatal error he
avoided. With unerring judgment he dwelt little
on that momentous issue which had only just been
displaced, and took his stand fairly upon that still
more momentous one which had so newly come up.
He spoke for the Union; upon that basis a united
North <i>ought</i> to support him; upon that basis the
more northern of the slave States might remain
loyal. As matter of fact, Union had suddenly
become the real issue, but it needed at the hands
of the President to be publicly and explicitly announced
as such; this recognition was essential;
he gave it on this earliest opportunity, and the announcement
was the first great service of the new
Republican ruler. It seems now as though he
could hardly have done otherwise, or have fallen
into the error of allying himself with bygone or
false issues. It may be admitted that he could
not have passed this new one by; but the important
matter was that of proportion and relation,
and in this it was easy to blunder. In truth it
was a crisis when blundering was so easy that
nearly all the really able men of the North had
been doing it badly for three or four months past,
and not a few of them were going to continue it
for two or three months to come. Therefore the
sound conception of the inaugural deserves to be
<!-- Image No 254 --><a name='Png254'></a><a name='Page228'></a><span class="pagenum">228</span>
considered as an indication, one among many, of
Lincoln's capacity for seeing with entire distinctness
the great main fact, and for recognizing it as
such. Other matters, which lay over and around
such a fact, side issues, questions of detail, affairs
of disguise or deception, never confused or misled
him. He knew with unerring accuracy where the
biggest fact lay, and he always anchored fast to it
and stayed with it. For many years he had been
anchored to anti-slavery; now, in the face of the
nation, he shifted his anchorage to the Union;
and each time he held securely.</p>

 For accounts of this journey and statements of the evidence
of a plot, see Schouler, <i>Hist. of Mass. in Civil War</i>, i. 59-65
(account by Samuel M. Felton, Prest. P.W. &amp; B.R.R. Co.);
N. and H. iii. ch. 19 and 20; Chittenden, <i>Recoll. of Lincoln</i>, x.;
Holland, 275; Arnold, 183-187; Lamon, ch. xx. (this account
ought to be, and doubtless is, the most trustworthy); Herndon,
492 (a bit of gossip which sounds improbable); Pinkerton, <i>Spy
of the Rebellion</i>, 45-103. On the anti-plot side of the question
the most important evidence is the little volume, <i>Baltimore and
the Nineteenth of April</i>, 1861, by George William Brown. This
witness, whose strict veracity is beyond question, was mayor of
the city. One of his statements, especially, is of the greatest
importance. It is obvious that, if the plot existed, one of two
things ought to occur on the morning of February 23, viz.: either
the plotters and the mobsmen should know that Mr. Lincoln had
escaped them, or else they should be at the station at the hour set
for his arrival. In fact they were not at the station; there was
no sudden assault on the cars, nor other indication of assassins
and a mob. Had they, then, received knowledge of what had occurred?
Those who sustain the plot-theory say that the news had
spread through the city, so that all the assassins and the gangs of
the &quot;Plug Uglies&quot; knew that their game was up. This was <i>possible</i>,
for Mr. Lincoln had arrived in the Washington station a few
minutes after six o'clock in the morning, and the train which was
expected to bring him to Baltimore did not arrive in Baltimore
until half after eleven o'clock. But, on the other hand, the news
was not dispatched from Washington immediately upon his arrival;
somewhat later, though still early in the morning, the detectives
telegraphed to the friends of Mr. Lincoln, but in cipher.
Just at what time intelligible telegrams, which would inform the
public, were sent out cannot be learned; but upon any arrangement
of hours it is obvious that the time was exceedingly short
for distributing the news throughout the lower quarters of Baltimore
by word of mouth, and there is no pretense of any publication.
But while the believers in the plot say, nevertheless, that
this had been done and that the story of the journey had spread
through the city so that all the assassins and &quot;Plug Uglies&quot;
knew it in time to avoid assembling at the railway station about
eleven o'clock, yet it appears that Mr. Brown, the mayor, knew
nothing about it. On the contrary, he tells us that in anticipation
of Mr. Lincoln's arrival he, &quot;as mayor of the city, accompanied
by the police commissioners and supported by a strong force of
police, was at the Calvert Street station on Saturday morning,
February 23, at 11.30 o'clock ... ready to receive with due
respect the incoming President. An open carriage was in waiting,
in which I was to have the honor of escorting Mr. Lincoln through
the city to the Washington station, and of sharing in any danger
which he might encounter. It is hardly necessary to say that I
apprehended none.&quot; To the &quot;great astonishment&quot; of Mr. Brown,
however, the train brought only &quot;Mrs. Lincoln and her three
sons,&quot; and &quot;it was then announced that he had passed through
the city <i>incognito</i> in the night train.&quot; This is a small bit of evidence
to set against the elaborate stories of the believers in the
plot, yet to some it will seem like the little obstruction which
suffices to throw a whole railway train from the track. I would
rather let any reader, who is sufficiently interested to examine
the matter, reach his own conclusion, than endeavor to furnish one
for him; for I think that a dispute more difficult of really conclusive
settlement will not easily be found.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h2>THE BEGINNING OF WAR</h2>

<p>From the inaugural ceremonies Lincoln drove
quietly back through Pennsylvania Avenue and
entered the White House, the President of the
United States,&mdash;alas, united no longer. Many
an anxious citizen breathed more freely when the
dreaded hours had passed without disturbance.
But burdens a thousand fold heavier than any
which were lifted from others descended upon the
new ruler. Save, however, that the thoughtful,
far-away expression of sadness had of late seemed
deeper and more impressive than ever before, Lincoln
gave no sign of inward trouble. His singular
temperament armed him with a rare and peculiar
strength beneath responsibility and in the face of
duty. He has been seen, with entire tranquillity,
not only seeking, but seeming to assume as his
natural due or destiny, positions which appeared
preposterously out of accord alike with his early
career and with his later opportunities for development.
In trying to explain this, it is easier to say
what was <i>not</i> the underlying quality than what it
was. Certainly there was no taint whatsoever of
that vulgar self-confidence which is so apt to lead
<!-- Image No 256 --><a name='Png256'></a><a name='Page230'></a><span class="pagenum">230</span>
the &quot;free and equal&quot; citizens of the great republic
into grotesque positions. Perhaps it was a
grand simplicity of faith; a profound instinctive
confidence that by patient, honest thinking it
would be possible to know the right road, and by
earnest enduring courage to follow it. Perhaps it
was that so-called divine inspiration which seems
always a part of the highest human fitness. The
fact which is distinctly visible is, that a fair, plain
and honest method of thinking saved him from
the perplexities which beset subtle dialecticians in
politics and in constitutional law. He had lately
said that his course was &quot;as plain as a turnpike
road;&quot; it was, to execute the public laws.</p>

<p>His duty was simple; his understanding of it
was unclouded by doubt or sophistry; his resolution
to do it was firm; but whether his hands
would be strengthened sufficiently to enable him
to do it was a question of grave anxiety. The
president of a republic can do everything if the
people are at his back, and almost nothing if the
people are not at his back. Where, then, were
now the people of the United States? In seven
States they were openly and unitedly against him;
in at least seven more they were under a very
strong temptation to range themselves against
him in case of a conflict; and as for the Republican
States of the North, on that fourth day of
March, 1861, no man could say to what point they
would sustain the administration. There had as
yet come slight indications of any change in the
<!-- Image No 257 --><a name='Png257'></a><a name='Page231'></a><span class="pagenum">231</span>
conceding, compromising temper of that section.
Greeley and Seward and Wendell Phillips, representative
men, were little better than Secessionists.
The statement sounds ridiculous, yet the proof
against each comes from his own mouth. The
&quot;Tribune&quot; had retracted none of those disunion
sentiments, of which examples have been given.
Even so late as April 10, 1861, Mr. Seward wrote
officially to Mr. C.F. Adams, minister to England:
&quot;Only an imperial and despotic government
could subjugate thoroughly disaffected and insurrectionary
members of the state. This federal, republican
country of ours is, of all forms of government,
the very one which is the most unfitted for
such a labor.&quot; He had been and still was favoring
delay and conciliation, in the visionary hope that
the seceders would follow the scriptural precedent
of the prodigal son. On April 9 the rumor of a
fight at Sumter being spread abroad, Mr. Phillips
said:<a name='FNanchor_132_134'></a><a href='#Footnote_132_134'><sup>[132]</sup></a>
 &quot;Here are a series of States, girding the
Gulf, who think that their peculiar institutions
require that they should have a separate government.
They have a right to decide that question
without appealing to you or me.... Standing
with the principles of '76 behind us, who can deny
them the right?... Abraham Lincoln has no
right to a soldier in Fort Sumter.... There is
no longer a Union.... Mr. Jefferson Davis is
<!-- Image No 258 --><a name='Png258'></a><a name='Page232'></a><span class="pagenum">232</span>
angry, and Mr. Abraham Lincoln is mad, and
they agree to fight.... You cannot go through
Massachusetts and recruit men to bombard Charleston
or New Orleans.... We are in no condition
to fight.... Nothing but madness can provoke
war with the Gulf States;&quot;&mdash;with much more to
the same effect.</p>

<p>If the veterans of the old anti-slavery contest
were in this frame of mind in April, Lincoln could
hardly place much dependence upon the people at
large in March. If he could not &quot;recruit men&quot;
in Massachusetts, in what State could he reasonably
expect to do so? Against such discouragement
it can only be said that he had a singular
instinct for the underlying popular feeling, that he
could scent it in the distance and in hiding; moreover,
that he was always willing to run the chance
of any consequences which might follow the performance
of a clear duty. Still, as he looked over
the dreary Northern field in those chill days of
early March, he must have had a marvelous sensitiveness
in order to perceive the generative heat
and force in the depths beneath the cheerless surface
and awaiting only the fullness of the near
spring season to burst forth in sudden universal
vigor. Yet such was his knowledge and such his
faith concerning the people that we may fancy, if
we will, that he foresaw the great transformation.
But there were still other matters which disturbed
him. Before his inauguration, he had heard much
of his coming official isolation. One of the arguments
<!-- Image No 259 --><a name='Png259'></a><a name='Page233'></a><span class="pagenum">233</span>
reiterated alike by Southern Unionists and
by Northerners had been that the Republican
President would be powerless, because the Senate,
the House, and the Supreme Court were all opposed
to him. But the supposed lack of political
sympathy on the part of these bodies, however it
might beget anxiety for the future, was for the
present of much less moment than another fact,
viz., that none of the distinguished men, leaders in
his own party, whom Lincoln found about him at
Washington, were in a frame of mind to assist him
efficiently. If all did not actually distrust his
capacity and character,&mdash;which, doubtless, many
honestly did,&mdash;at least they were profoundly ignorant
concerning both. Therefore they could not
yet, and did not, place genuine, implicit confidence
in him; they could not yet, and did not, advise and
aid him at all in the same spirit and with the same
usefulness as later they were able to do. They
were not to blame for this; on the contrary, the
condition had been brought about distinctly against
their will, since certainly few of them had looked
with favor upon the selection of an unknown, inexperienced,
ill-educated man as the Republican
candidate for the presidency. How much Lincoln
felt his loneliness will never be known; for, reticent
and self-contained at all times, he gave no
outward sign. That he felt it less than other men
would have done may be regarded as certain; for,
as has already appeared to some extent, and as
will appear much more in this narrative, he was
<!-- Image No 260 --><a name='Png260'></a><a name='Page234'></a><span class="pagenum">234</span>
singularly self-reliant, and, at least in appearance,
was strangely indifferent to any counsel or support
which could be brought to him by others. Yet,
marked as was this trait in him, he could hardly
have been human had he not felt oppressed by the
personal solitude and political isolation of his position
when the responsibility of his great office
rested newly upon him. Under all these circumstances,
if this lonely man moved slowly and cautiously
during the early weeks of his administration,
it was not at his door that the people had the
right to lay the reproach of weakness or hesitation.</p>

<p>Mr. Buchanan, for the convenience of his successor,
had called an extra session of the Senate,
and on March 5 President Lincoln sent in the
nominations for his cabinet. All were immediately
confirmed, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="display">
<p>
William H. Seward, New York, secretary of state.<br />
Salmon P. Chase, Ohio, secretary of the treasury.<br />
Simon Cameron, Pennsylvania, secretary of war.<br />
Gideon Welles, Connecticut, secretary of the navy.<br />
Caleb B. Smith, Indiana, secretary of the interior.<br />
Edward Bates, Missouri, attorney-general.<br />
Montgomery Blair, Maryland, postmaster-general.
</p>
</div>

<p>It is matter of course that a cabinet slate should
fail to give general satisfaction; and this one encountered
fully the average measure of criticism.
The body certainly was somewhat heterogeneous
in its composition, yet the same was true of the
Republican party which it represented. Nor was
it by any means so heterogeneous as Mr. Lincoln
<!-- Image No 261 --><a name='Png261'></a><a name='Page235'></a><span class="pagenum">235</span>
had designed to have it, for he had made efforts
to place in it a Southern spokesman for Southern
views; and he had not desisted from the purpose
until its futility was made apparent by the direct
refusal of Mr. Gilmer of North Carolina, and by
indications of a like unwillingness on the part of
one or two other Southerners who were distantly
sounded on the subject. Seward, Chase, Bates,
and Cameron were the four men who had manifested
the greatest popularity, after Lincoln, in
the national convention, and the selection of them,
therefore, showed that Mr. Lincoln was seeking
strength rather than amity in his cabinet; for it
was certainly true that each one of them had a following
which was far from being wholly in sympathy
with the following of any one of the others.
The President evidently believed that it was of
more importance that each great body of Northern
men should feel that its opinions were fairly presented,
than that his cabinet officers should always
comfortably unite in looking at questions from
one and the same point of view. Judge Davis
says that Lincoln's original design was to appoint
Democrats and Republicans alike to office. He
carried this theory so far that the radical Republicans
regarded the make-up of the cabinet as a
&quot;disgraceful surrender to the South;&quot; while men
of less extreme views saw with some alarm that he
had called to his advisory council four ex-Democrats
and only three ex-Whigs, a criticism which
he met by saying that he himself was an &quot;old-line
<!-- Image No 262 --><a name='Png262'></a><a name='Page236'></a><span class="pagenum">236</span>
Whig&quot; and should be there to make the parties
even. On the other hand, the Republicans of the
middle line of States grumbled much at the selection
of Bates and Blair as representatives of their
section.</p>

<p>The cabinet had not been brought together without
some jarring and friction, especially in the
case of Cameron. On December 31 Mr. Lincoln
intimated to him that he should have either the
Treasury or the War Department, but on January
3 requested him to &quot;decline the appointment.&quot;
Cameron, however, had already mentioned the
matter to many friends, without any suggestion
that he should not be glad to accept either position,
and therefore, even if he were willing to accede to
the sudden, strange, and unexplained request of
Mr. Lincoln, he would have found it difficult to
do so without giving rise to much embarrassing
gossip. Accordingly he did not decline, and thereupon
ensued much wire-pulling. Pennsylvania
protectionists wanted Cameron in the Treasury,
and strenuously objected to Chase as an ex-Democrat
of free-trade proclivities. On the other hand,
Lincoln gradually hardened into the resolution that
Chase should have the Treasury. He made the
tender, and it was accepted. He then offered
consolation to Pennsylvania by giving the War
portfolio to Cameron, which was accepted with
something of chagrin. How far this Cameron
episode was affected by the bargain declared by
Lamon to have been made at Chicago cannot be
<!-- Image No 263 --><a name='Png263'></a><a name='Page237'></a><span class="pagenum">237</span>
told. Other biographers ignore this story, but I
do not see how the direct testimony furnished by
Lamon and corroborated by Colonel McClure can
justly be treated in this way; neither is the temptation
so to treat it apparent, since the evidence
entirely absolves Lincoln from any complicity at
the time of making the alleged &quot;trade,&quot; while he
could hardly be blamed if he felt somewhat hampered
by it afterward.</p>

<p>Seward also gave trouble which he ought not
to have given. On December 8 Lincoln wrote to
him that he would nominate him as secretary of
state. Mr. Seward assented and the matter remained
thus comfortably settled until so late as
March 2, 1861, when Seward wrote a brief note
asking &quot;leave to withdraw his consent.&quot; Apparently
the Democratic complexion of the cabinet,
and the suggestions of suspicious friends, made
him fear that his influence in the ministry would
be inferior to that of Chase. Coming at this
eleventh hour, which already had its weighty
burden of many anxieties, this brief destructive
note was both embarrassing and exasperating. It
meant the entire reconstruction of the cabinet.
Never did Lincoln's tranquil indifference to personal
provocation stand him in better stead than
in this crisis,&mdash;for a crisis it was when Seward,
in discontent and distrust, desired to draw aloof
from the administration. He held the note of the
recalcitrant politician for two days unanswered,
then he wrote a few lines: &quot;Your note,&quot; he said,
&quot;is the subject of the most painful solicitude with
<!-- Image No 264 --><a name='Png264'></a><a name='Page238'></a><span class="pagenum">238</span>
me; and I feel constrained to beg that you will
countermand the withdrawal. The public interest,
I think, demands that you should; and my personal
feelings are deeply enlisted in the same direction.&quot;
These words set Mr. Seward right again; on
March 5 he withdrew his letter of March 2, and
in a few hours was appointed.</p>

<p>Immediately after the installation of the new
government three commissioners from the Confederacy
came to Washington, and requested an official
audience. They said that seven States of the
American Union had withdrawn therefrom, had
reassumed sovereign power, and were now an independent
nation in fact and in right; that, in
order to adjust upon terms of amity and good-will
all questions growing out of this political separation,
they were instructed to make overtures for
opening negotiations, with the assurance that the
Confederate government earnestly desired a peaceful
solution and would make no demand not
founded in strictest justice, neither do any act to
injure their late confederates. From the Confederate
point of view these approaches were dignified
and conciliatory; from the Northern point of view
they were treasonable and insolent. Probably the
best fruit which Mr. Davis hoped from them was
that Mr. Seward, who was well known to be desirous
of finding some peace-assuring middle course,
might be led into a discussion of the situation,
inevitably provoking divisions in the cabinet, in
<!-- Image No 265 --><a name='Png265'></a><a name='Page239'></a><span class="pagenum">239</span>
the Republican party, and in the country. But
though Seward's frame of mind about this time
was such as to put him in great jeopardy of committing
hurtful blunders, he was fortunate enough
to escape quite doing so. To the agent of the commissioners
he replied that he must &quot;consult the
President,&quot; and the next day he wrote, in terms of
personal civility, that he could not receive them.
Nevertheless they remained in Washington a few
weeks longer, gathering and forwarding to the
Confederate government such information as they
could. In this they were aided by Judge Campbell
of Alabama, a Secessionist, who still retained
his seat upon the bench of the Supreme Court.
This gentleman now became a messenger between
the commissioners and Mr. Seward, with the purpose
of eliciting news and even pledges from the
latter for the use of the former. His errands
especially related to Fort Sumter, and he gradually
drew from Mr. Seward strong expressions of
opinion that Sumter would in time be evacuated,
even declarations substantially to the effect that
this was the arranged policy of the government.
Words which fell in so agreeably with the wishes
of the judge and the commissioners were received
with that warm welcome which often outruns correct
construction, and later were construed by them
as actual assurances, at least in substance, whereby
they conceived themselves to have been &quot;abused
and overreached,&quot; and they charged the government
with &quot;equivocating conduct.&quot; In the second
<!-- Image No 266 --><a name='Png266'></a><a name='Page240'></a><span class="pagenum">240</span>
week in April, contemporaneously with the Sumter
crisis, they addressed to Mr. Seward a high-flown
missive of reproach, in which they ostentatiously
washed the hands of the South, as it were,
and shook from their own departing feet the dust
of the obdurate North, where they had not been
met &quot;in the conciliatory and peaceful spirit&quot; in
which they had come. They invoked &quot;impartial
history&quot; to place the responsibility of blood and
mourning upon those who had denied the great
fundamental doctrine of American liberty; and
they declared it &quot;clear that Mr. Lincoln had determined
to appeal to the sword to reduce the people
of the Confederate States to the will of the
section or party whose President he is.&quot; In this
dust-cloud of glowing rhetoric vanished the last
deceit of peaceful settlement.</p>

<p>About the same time, April 13, sundry commissioners
from the Virginia convention waited upon
Lincoln with the request that he would communicate
the policy which he intended to pursue towards
the Confederate States. Lincoln replied
with a patient civility that cloaked satire: &quot;Having
at the beginning of my official term expressed
my intended policy as plainly as I was able, it is
with deep regret and some mortification I now
learn that there is great and injurious uncertainty
in the public mind as to what that policy is, and
what course I intend to pursue.&quot; To this ratification
of the plain position taken in his inaugural,
he added that he might see fit to repossess himself
<!-- Image No 267 --><a name='Png267'></a><a name='Page241'></a><span class="pagenum">241</span>
of the public property, and that possibly he
might withdraw the mail service from the seceding
States.</p>

<p>The inauguration of Mr. Lincoln was followed
by a lull which endured for several weeks. A
like repose reigned contemporaneously in the Confederate
States. For a while the people in both
sections received with content this reaction of quiescence.
But as the same laws of human nature
were operative equally at the North and at the
South, it soon came about that both at the North
and at the South there broke forth almost simultaneously
strong manifestations of impatience. The
genuine President at Washington and the sham
President at Montgomery were assailed by the
like pressing demand: Why did they not do something
to settle this matter? Southern irascibility
found the situation exceedingly trying. The imposing
and dramatic attitude of the Confederate
States had not achieved an appropriate result.
They had organized a government and posed as an
independent nation, but no power in the civilized
world had yet recognized them in this character;
on the contrary, Abraham Lincoln, living hard
by in the White House, was explicitly denying it,
contumaciously alleging himself to be their lawful
ruler, and waiting with an exasperating patience
to see what they were really going to do in the
business which they had undertaken. They must
make some move or they would become ridiculous,
and their revolution would die and their confederacy
<!-- Image No 268 --><a name='Png268'></a><a name='Page242'></a><span class="pagenum">242</span>
would dissolve from sheer inanition. The
newspapers told their leaders this plainly; and
a prominent gentleman of Alabama said to Mr.
Davis: &quot;Sir, unless you sprinkle blood in the
face of the people of Alabama, they will be back
in the Union in ten days.&quot; On the other hand,
the people of the North were as energetic as the
sons of the South were excitable, and with equal
urgency they also demanded a conclusion. If the
Union was to be enforced, why did not Mr. Lincoln
enforce it? How long did he mean placidly
to suffer treason and a rival government to rest
undisturbed within the country?</p>

<p>With this state of feeling growing rapidly more
intense in both sections, action was inevitable.
Yet neither leader wished to act first, even for the
important purpose of gratifying the popular will.
As where two men are resolved to fight, yet have
an uneasy vision of a judge and jury in waiting
for them, each seeks to make the other the assailant
and himself to be upon his defense, so these
two rulers took prudent thought of the tribunal
of public sentiment not in America alone but in
Europe also, with perhaps a slight forward glance
towards posterity. If Mr. Lincoln did not like
to &quot;invade&quot; the Southern territory, Mr. Davis
was equally reluctant to make the Southern &quot;withdrawal&quot;
actively belligerent through operations of
military offense. Both men were capable of statesmanlike
waiting to score a point that was worth
waiting for; Davis had been for years biding the
<!-- Image No 269 --><a name='Png269'></a><a name='Page243'></a><span class="pagenum">243</span>
ripeness of time, but Lincoln had the capacity of
patience beyond any precedent on record.</p>

<p>The spot where the strain came, where this
question of the first blow must be settled, was at
Fort Sumter, in the mid-throat of Charleston harbor.
On December 27, 1860, by a skillful movement
at night, Major Anderson, the commander
at Fort Moultrie, had transferred his scanty force
from that dilapidated and untenable post on the
shore to the more defensible and more important
position of Fort Sumter. Thereafter a precarious
relationship betwixt peace and war had subsisted
between him and the South Carolinians. It was
distinctly understood that, sooner or later, by negotiation
or by force, South Carolina intended to
possess herself of this fortress. From her point of
view it certainly was preposterous and unendurable
that the key to her chief harbor and city should be
permanently held by a &quot;foreign&quot; power. Gradually
she erected batteries on the neighboring mainland,
and kept a close surveillance upon the troops
now more than half besieged in the fort.</p>

<p>Under the Buchanan r&eacute;gime the purpose of the
United States government had been less plain
than it became after Mr. Lincoln's accession; for
Buchanan had not the courage either to order a
surrender, or to provoke real warfare by reinforcing
the place. In vain did the unfortunate Major
Anderson seek distinct instructions; the replies
which he received were contradictory and more
obscure than Delphic oracles. This unfair, vacillating,
<!-- Image No 270 --><a name='Png270'></a><a name='Page244'></a><span class="pagenum">244</span>
and contemptible conduct indicated the desire
to lay upon him alone the whole responsibility
of the situation, with a politic and selfish reservation
to the government of the advantage of disavowing
and discrediting him, whatever he might
do. On January 9 a futile effort at communication
was made by the steamer Star of the West;
it failed, and left matters worse rather than better.
On March 3, 1861, the Confederate government
put General Beauregard in command at Charleston,
thereby emphasizing the resolution to have
Sumter ere long. Such was the situation on
March 4, when Mr. Lincoln came into control
and declared a policy which bound him to &quot;hold,
occupy, and possess&quot; Sumter. On the same day
there came a letter from Major Anderson, describing
his position. There were shut up in the fort
together a certain number of men and a certain
quantity of biscuit and of pork; when the men
should have eaten the biscuit and the pork, which
they would probably do in about four weeks, they
would have to go away. The problem thus became
direct, simple, and urgent.</p>

<p>Lincoln sought an opinion from Scott, and was
told that &quot;evacuation seems almost inevitable.&quot;
He requested a more thorough investigation, and
a reply to specific questions: &quot;To what point of
time can Anderson maintain his position in Sumter?
Can you, with present means, relieve him in
that time? What additional means would enable
you to do so?&quot; The general answered that four
<!-- Image No 271 --><a name='Png271'></a><a name='Page245'></a><span class="pagenum">245</span>
months would be necessary to prepare the naval
force, and an even longer time to get together the
5000 regular troops and 20,000 volunteers that
would be needed, to say nothing of obtaining
proper legislation from Congress. Equally discouraging
were the opinions of the cabinet officers.
On March 15 Lincoln put to them the question:
&quot;Assuming it to be possible to now provision Fort
Sumter, under all the circumstances is it wise to
attempt it?&quot; Only Chase and Blair replied that
it would be wise; Seward, Cameron, Wells, Smith,
and Bates were against it.</p>

<p>The form of this question indicated that Lincoln
contemplated a possibility of being compelled to
recede from the policy expressed in his inaugural.
Yet it was not his temperament to abandon a
purpose deliberately matured and definitely announced,
except under absolute necessity. To determine
now this question of necessity he sent an
emissary to Sumter and another to Charleston,
and meantime stayed offensive action on the part
of the Confederates by authorizing Seward to give
assurance through Judge Campbell that no provisioning
or reinforcement should be attempted without
warning. Thus he secured, or continued, a
sort of truce, irregular and informal, but practical.
Meantime he was encouraged by the earnest propositions
of Mr. G.V. Fox, until lately an officer
of the navy, who was ready to undertake the relief
of the fort. Eager discussions ensued, wherein
naval men backed the project of Mr. Fox, and
<!-- Image No 272 --><a name='Png272'></a><a name='Page246'></a><span class="pagenum">246</span>
army men condemned it. Such difference of expert
opinion was trying, for the problem was of a
kind which Mr. Lincoln's previous experience in
life did not make it easy for him to solve with any
confidence in the correctness of his own judgment.</p>

<p>Amid this puzzlement day after day glided by,
and the question remained unsettled. Yet during
this lapse of time sentiment was ripening, and perhaps
this was the real purpose of Lincoln's patient
waiting. On March 29 his ministers again put
their opinions in writing, and now Chase, Welles,
and Blair favored an effort at reinforcement;
Bates modified his previous opposition so far as
to say that the time had come either to evacuate
or relieve the fort; Smith favored evacuation, but
only on the ground of military necessity; and
Seward alone advocated evacuation in part on the
ground of policy; he deemed it unwise to &quot;provoke
a civil war,&quot; especially &quot;in rescue of an untenable
position.&quot;</p>

<p>Was it courtesy or curiosity that induced the
President to sit and listen to this warm debate
between his chosen advisers? They would have
been angry had they known that they were bringing
their counsel to a chief who had already made
his decision. They did not yet know that upon
every occasion of great importance Lincoln would
make up his mind for and by himself, yet would
not announce his decision, or save his counselors
the trouble of counseling, until such time as he
should see fit to act. So in this instance he had
<!-- Image No 273 --><a name='Png273'></a><a name='Page247'></a><span class="pagenum">247</span>
already, the day before the meeting of the cabinet,
directed Fox to draw up an order for such ships,
men, and supplies as he would require, and when
the meeting broke up he at once issued formal
orders to the secretaries of the navy and of war to
enter upon the necessary preparation.</p>

<p>Contemporaneously with this there was also undertaken
another enterprise for the relief of Fort
Pickens at Pensacola. It was, however, kept so
strictly secret that the President did not even
communicate it to Mr. Welles. Apparently his
only reason for such extreme reticence lay in the
proverb: &quot;If you wish your secret kept, keep it.&quot;
But proverbial wisdom had an unfortunate result
upon this occasion. Both the President and Mr.
Welles set the eye of desire upon the warship
Powhatan, lying in New York harbor. The secretary
designed her for the Sumter fleet; the President
meant to send her to Pensacola. Of the
Sumter expedition she was an absolutely essential
part; for the Pensacola plan she was not altogether
indispensable.</p>

<p>On April 6 Captain Mercer, on board the Powhatan
as his flagship, and on the very point of
weighing anchor to sail in command of the Sumter
reinforcement, under orders from Secretary
Welles, was astounded to find himself dispossessed
and superseded by Lieutenant Porter, who suddenly
came upon the deck bringing an order signed
by the President himself. A few hours later, at
Washington, a telegram startled Mr. Welles with
<!-- Image No 274 --><a name='Png274'></a><a name='Page248'></a><span class="pagenum">248</span>
the news. Utterly confounded, he hastened, in
the early night-time, to the White House, and
obtained an audience of the President. Then Mr.
Lincoln learned what a disastrous blunder he
had made; greatly mortified, he requested Mr.
Seward to telegraph with all haste to New York
that the Powhatan must be immediately restored
to Mercer for Sumter. Lieutenant Porter was
already far down the bay, when he was overtaken
by a swift tug bringing this message. But unfortunately
Mr. Seward had so phrased the dispatch
that it did not purport to convey an order either
from the President or the secretary of the navy,
and he had signed his own name: &quot;Give up the
Powhatan to Mercer. SEWARD.&quot; To Porter, hurriedly
considering this unintelligible occurrence,
it seemed better to go forward under the President's
order than to obey the order of an official
who had no apparent authority to command him.
So he steamed on for Pensacola.</p>

<p>On April 8, discharging the obligation of warning,
Mr. Lincoln notified General Beauregard that
an attempt would be made to put provisions into
Sumter, but not at present to put in men, arms,
or ammunition, unless the fort should be attacked.
Thereupon Beauregard, at two o'clock P.M. on
April 11, sent to Anderson a request for a surrender.
Anderson refused, remarking incidentally
that he should be starved out in a few days. At
3.20 A.M., on April 12, Beauregard notified Anderson
that he should open fire in one hour. That
<!-- Image No 275 --><a name='Png275'></a><a name='Page249'></a><span class="pagenum">249</span>
morning the occupants of Sumter, 9 commissioned
officers, 68 non-commissioned officers and privates,
8 musicians, and 43 laborers, breakfasted on pork
and water, the last rations in the fort. Before
daybreak the Confederate batteries were pouring
shot and shell against the walls. Response was
made from as many guns as the small body of
defenders could handle. But the fort was more
easily damaged than were the works on the mainland,
and on the morning of the 13th, the officers'
quarters having caught fire, and the magazine being
so imperiled that it had to be closed and covered
with earth, the fort became untenable. Early
in the evening terms of capitulation were agreed
upon.</p>

<p>Meantime three transports of the relief expedition
were lying outside the bar. The first arrived
shortly before the bombardment began, the other
two came only a trifle later. All day long these
vessels lay to, wondering why the Powhatan did
not appear. Had she been there upon the critical
night of the 12th, the needed supplies could have
been thrown into the fort, for the weather was so
dark that the rebel patrol was useless, and it was
actually believed in Charleston that the relief had
been accomplished. But the Powhatan was far
away steaming at full speed for Pensacola. For
this sad blunder Lincoln generously, but fairly
enough, took the blame to himself. The only
excuse which has ever been advanced in behalf of
Mr. Lincoln is that he allowed himself to be led
<!-- Image No 276 --><a name='Png276'></a><a name='Page250'></a><span class="pagenum">250</span>
blindfold through this important business by Mr.
Seward, and that he signed such papers as the secretary
of state presented to him without learning
their purport and bearing. But such an excuse,
even if it can be believed, seems fully as bad as
the blunder which it is designed to palliate.</p>

<p>Other blame also has been laid upon Lincoln
on the ground that he was dilatory in reaching
the determination to relieve the fort. That the
decision should have been reached and the expedition
dispatched more promptly is entirely evident;
but whether or not Lincoln was in fault is quite
another question. Three facts are to be considered:
1. The highest military authority in the
country advised him, a civilian, that evacuation
was a necessity. 2. Most of his ministers were
at first against reinforcement, and they never
unanimously recommended it; especially his secretary
of state condemned it as bad policy. 3. The
almost universal feeling of the people of the
North, so far as it could then be divined, was
compromising, conciliatory, and thoroughly opposed
to any act of war. Under such circumstances it
was rather an exhibition of independence and
courage that Lincoln reached the conclusion of
relieving the fort at all, than it was a cause of
fault-finding that he did not come to the conclusion
sooner. He could not know in March how
the people were going to feel after the 13th of
April; in fact, if they had fancied that he was
provoking hostilities, their feeling might not even
<!-- Image No 277 --><a name='Png277'></a><a name='Page251'></a><span class="pagenum">251</span>
then have developed as it did. Finally, he gained
his point in forcing the Confederacy into the position
of assailant, and there is every reason to
believe that he bought that point cheaply at the
price of the fortress.</p>

<p>The news of the capture of Sumter had an instant
and tremendous effect. The States which
had seceded were thrown into a pleasurable ferment
of triumph; the Northern States arose in
fierce wrath; the Middle States, still balancing
dubiously between the two parties, were rent
with passionate discussion. For the moment the
North seemed a unit; there had been Southern
sympathizers before, and Southern sympathizers
appeared in considerable numbers later, but for
a little while just now they were very scarce.
Douglas at once called upon the President, and
the telegraph carried to his numerous followers
throughout the land the news that he had pledged
himself &quot;to sustain the President in the exercise
of all his constitutional functions to preserve the
Union, and maintain the government, and defend
the Federal capital.&quot; By this prompt and generous
action he warded off the peril of a divided
North. Douglas is not in quite such good repute
with posterity as he deserves to be; his attitude
towards slavery was bad, but his attitude towards
the country was that of a zealous patriot. His
veins were full of fighting blood, and he was really
much more ready to go to war for the Union than
were great numbers of Republicans whose names
<!-- Image No 278 --><a name='Png278'></a><a name='Page252'></a><span class="pagenum">252</span>
survive in the strong odor of patriotism. During
the presidential campaign he had been speaking
out with defiant courage regardless of personal
considerations, and in this present juncture he did
not hesitate an instant to bring to his successful
rival an aid which at the time and under the circumstances
was invaluable.</p>

<p>In every town and village there were now mass
meetings, ardent speeches, patriotic resolutions, a
confusing stir and tumult of words that would become
deeds as fast as definite plans could furnish
opportunity. The difficulty lay in utilizing this
abundant, this exuberant zeal. Historians say
rhetorically that the North sprang to arms; and
it really would have done so if there had been
any arms to spring to; but muskets were scarce,
and that there were any at all was chiefly due to
the fact that antiquated and unserviceable weapons
had been allowed to accumulate undestroyed.
Moreover, no one knew even the manual of arms;
and there were no uniforms, or accoutrements, or
camp equipment of any sort. There was, however,
the will which makes the way. Simultaneously
with the story of Sumter came also the President's
proclamation of April 15. He called for
seventy-five thousand volunteers to serve for three
months,&mdash;an insignificant body of men, as it now
seems, and a period of time not sufficient to
change them from civilians into soldiers. Yet for
the work immediately visible the demand seemed
adequate. Moreover, as the law stood, a much
<!-- Image No 279 --><a name='Png279'></a><a name='Page253'></a><span class="pagenum">253</span>
longer term could not have been named,<a name='FNanchor_133_135'></a><a href='#Footnote_133_135'><sup>[133]</sup></a>
 and an
apparently disproportionate requisition in point of
numbers might have been of injurious effect; for
nearly every one was cheerfully saying that the
war would be no such very great affair after all.
In his own mind the President may or may not
have forecast the future more accurately than most
others were doing; but his idea plainly was to ask
no more than was necessary for the visible occasion.
He stated that the troops would be used to
&quot;repossess the forts, places, and property which
had been seized from the Union,&quot; and that great
care would be taken not to disturb peaceful citizens.
Amid all the prophesying and theorizing,
and the fanciful comparisons of the respective
fighting qualities of the Northern and Southern
populations, a sensible remark is attributed to
Lincoln: &quot;We must not forget that the people of
the seceded States, like those of the loyal States,
are American citizens with essentially the same
characteristics and powers. Exceptional advantages
on one side are counterbalanced by exceptional
advantages on the other. We must make
up our minds that man for man the soldier from
the South will be a match for the soldier from the
North, and <i>vice versa</i>.&quot; This was good common
sense, seasonably offsetting the prevalent but foolish
<!-- Image No 280 --><a name='Png280'></a><a name='Page254'></a><span class="pagenum">254</span>
notion that the Southerners were naturally a
better fighting race than the Northerners. Facts
ultimately sustained Lincoln's just estimate of
equality; for though the North employed far
greater numbers than did the South, it was because
the North had the burdens of attack and
conquest upon exterior lines of great extent, because
it had to detail large bodies of troops for
mere garrison and quasi-police duty, and because
during the latter part of the war it took miserable
throngs of bounty-bought foreigners into its ranks.
Man for man, as Lincoln said at the outset, the
war proved that Northern Americans and Southern
Americans were closely matched.<a name='FNanchor_134_136'></a><a href='#Footnote_134_136'><sup>[134]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>By the same instrument the President summoned
Congress to assemble in extra session on July 4.
It seemed a distant date; and many thought that
the Executive Department ought not to endeavor
to handle alone all the possible novel developments
of so long a period. But Mr. Lincoln had his
purposes. By July 4 he and circumstances, together,
would have wrought out definite conditions,
which certainly did not exist at present; perhaps
also, like most men who find themselves face to
face with difficult practical affairs, he dreaded the
<!-- Image No 281 --><a name='Png281'></a><a name='Page255'></a><span class="pagenum">255</span>
conclaves of the law-makers; but especially he
wished to give Kentucky a chance to hold a special
election for choosing members of this Congress,
because the moral and political value of Kentucky
could hardly be overestimated, and the most tactful
manoeuvring was necessary to control her.</p>

<p>The Confederate cabinet was said to have
greeted Mr. Lincoln's proclamation with &quot;bursts
of laughter.&quot; The governors of Kentucky, North
Carolina, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Missouri telegraphed
that no troops would be furnished by
their respective States, using language clearly
designed to be offensive and menacing. The
Northern States, however, responded promptly and
enthusiastically. Men thronged to enlist. Hundreds
of thousands offered themselves where only
75,000 could be accepted. Of the human raw
material there was excess; but discipline and
equipment could not be created by any measure
of mere willingness. Yet there was great need
of dispatch. Both geographically and politically
Washington lay as an advanced outpost in immediate
peril. General Scott had been collecting the
few companies within reach; but all, he said on
April 8, &quot;may be too late for this place.&quot; By
April 15, however, he believed himself able to
hold the city till reinforcements should arrive.
The total nominal strength of the United States
army, officers and men, was only 17,113, of whom
not two thirds could be counted upon the Union
side, and even these were scattered over a vast
<!-- Image No 282 --><a name='Png282'></a><a name='Page256'></a><span class="pagenum">256</span>
expanse of country, playing police for Indians,
and garrisoning distant posts. Rumors of Southern
schemes to attack Washington caused widespread
alarm; the government had no more definite
information than the people, and all alike
feared that there was to be a race for the capital,
and that the South, being near and prepared,
would get there first. As matter of fact, the
Southern leaders had laid no military plan for
this enterprise, and the danger was exaggerated.
The Northerners, however, did not know this, and
made desperate haste.</p>

<p>The first men to arrive came from Philadelphia,
460 troops, as they were called, though they came
&quot;almost entirely without arms.&quot; In Massachusetts,
Governor Andrew, an anti-slavery leader,
enthusiastic, energetic, and of great executive
ability, had been for many months preparing the
militia for precisely this crisis, weeding out the
holiday soldiers and thoroughly equipping his regiments
for service in the field. For this he had
been merrily ridiculed by the aristocracy of Boston
during the winter; but inexorable facts now
declared for him and against the local aristocrats.
On April 15 he received the call from Washington,
and immediately sent forth his own summons
through the State. All day on the 16th, amid a
fierce northeasterly storm, the troops poured into
Boston, and by six o'clock on that day three full
regiments were ready to start.<a name='FNanchor_135_137'></a><a href='#Footnote_135_137'><sup>[135]</sup></a>
 Three days before
<!-- Image No 283 --><a name='Png283'></a><a name='Page257'></a><span class="pagenum">257</span>
this the governor had asked Secretary Cameron
for 2000 rifled muskets from the national armory
at Springfield, in the State. The secretary refused,
and the governor managed to supply his
regiment with the most improved arms<a name='FNanchor_136_138'></a><a href='#Footnote_136_138'><sup>[136]</sup></a>
 without
aid from the national government. On the forenoon
of the 17th, the Sixth Regiment started for
Washington. Steamers were ready to take it to
Annapolis; but the secretary of war, with astonishing
ignorance of facts easily to be known, ordered
it to come through Baltimore. Accordingly
the regiment reached Baltimore on the 19th, the
anniversary of the battle of Lexington. Seven
companies were transported in horse-cars from
the northern to the southern station without serious
hindrance; but then the tracks of the street
railway were torn up, and the remaining four
companies had to leave the cars and march. A
furious mob of &quot;Plug Uglies&quot; and Secessionists
assailed them with paving-stones, brickbats, and
pistol-shots. The mayor and the marshal of the
police force performed fairly their official duty,
but were far from quelling the riot. The troops,
therefore, thrown on their own resources, justifiably
fired upon their assailants. The result of
the conflict was that 4 soldiers were killed and 36
were wounded, and of the rioters 12 were killed,
and the number of wounded could not be ascertained.
The troops reached Washington at five
o'clock in the afternoon, the first armed rescuers
<!-- Image No 284 --><a name='Png284'></a><a name='Page258'></a><span class="pagenum">258</span>
of the capital; their presence brought a comforting
sense of relief, and they were quartered in the
senate chamber itself.</p>

<hr class='short'/>

<p>What would be the effect of the proclamation,
of the mustering of troops in the capital, and of
the bloodshed at Baltimore upon the slave States
which still remained in the Union, was a problem
of immeasurable importance. The President, who
had been obliged to take the responsibility of precipitating
the crisis in these States, appreciated
more accurately than any one else the magnitude of
the stake involved in their allegiance. He watched
them with the deepest anxiety, and brought the
utmost care and tact of his nature to the task of
influencing them. The geographical position of
Maryland, separating the District of Columbia
from the loyal North, made it of the first consequence.
The situation there, precarious at best,
seemed to be rendered actually hopeless by what
had occurred. A tempest of uncontrollable rage
whirled away the people and prostrated all Union
feeling. Mayor Brown admits that &quot;for some days
it looked very much as if Baltimore had taken her
stand decisively with the South;&quot; and this was
putting it mildly, when the Secessionist Marshal
Kane was telegraphing: &quot;Streets red with Maryland
blood. Send express over the mountains of
Maryland and Virginia for the riflemen to come
without delay.&quot; Governor Hicks was opposed to
secession, but he was shaken like a reed by this
<!-- Image No 285 --><a name='Png285'></a><a name='Page259'></a><span class="pagenum">259</span>
violent blast. Later on this same April 19, Mayor
Brown sent three gentlemen to President Lincoln,
bearing a letter from himself, in which he
said that it was &quot;not possible for more soldiers
to pass through Baltimore unless they fight their
way at every step.&quot; That night he caused the
northward railroad bridges to be burned and disabled;
and soon afterward the telegraph wires
were cut.</p>

<p>The President met the emergency with coolness
and straightforward simplicity, abiding firmly by
his main purpose, but conciliatory as to means.
He wrote to the governor and the mayor: &quot;For
the future troops <i>must</i> be brought here, but I
make no point of bringing them <i>through</i> Baltimore;&quot;
he would &quot;march them <i>around</i> Baltimore,&quot;
if, as he hoped, General Scott should find
it feasible to do so. In fulfillment of this promise
he ordered a detachment, which had arrived at a
station near Baltimore, to go all the way back to
Philadelphia and come around by water. He only
demurred when the protests were extended to include
the whole &quot;sacred&quot; soil of Maryland,&mdash;for
it appeared that the presence of slavery accomplished
the consecration of soil! His troops, he
said, could neither fly over the State, nor burrow
under it; therefore they must cross it, and the
Marylanders must learn that &quot;there was no piece
of American soil too good to be pressed by the
foot of a loyal soldier on his march to the defense
of the capital of his country.&quot; For a while, however,
<!-- Image No 286 --><a name='Png286'></a><a name='Page260'></a><span class="pagenum">260</span>
until conditions in Baltimore changed, Eastern
regiments came by way of Annapolis, though
with difficulty and delay. Yet, even upon this
route, conflict was narrowly avoided.</p>

<p>Soon, however, these embarrassments came to
an end, and the President's policy was vindicated
by its fruits. It had been strictly his own; he
alone ruled the occasion, and he did so in the face
of severe pressure to do otherwise, some of which
came even from members of his cabinet. Firmness,
reasonableness, and patience brought things
right; Lincoln spoke sensibly to the Marylanders,
and gave them time to consider the situation. Such
treatment started a reaction; Unionism revived
and Unionists regained courage. Moreover, the
sure pressure of material considerations was doing
its work. Baltimore, as an isolated secession outpost,
found, even in the short space of a week, that
business was destroyed and that she was suffering
every day financial loss. In a word, by the end of
the month, &quot;the tide had turned.&quot; Baltimore, if
not quite a Union city, at least ceased to be secessionist.
On May 9 Northern troops passed unmolested
through it. On May 13 General Butler with
a body of troops took possession of Federal Hill,
which commands the harbor and city, and fortified
it. If the Baltimore question was still open at that
time, this settled it. Early in the same month the
state legislature came together, Mr. Lincoln refusing
to accept the suggestion of interfering with it.
This body was by no means Unionist, for it &quot;protested
<!-- Image No 287 --><a name='Png287'></a><a name='Page261'></a><span class="pagenum">261</span>
against the war as unjust and unconstitutional,
announced a determination to take no part
in its prosecution, and expressed a desire for the
immediate recognition of the Confederate States.&quot;
Yet practically it put a veto on secession by voting
that it was inexpedient to summon a convention;
it called on all good citizens &quot;to abstain from violent
and unlawful interference with the troops.&quot;
Thus early in May this brand, though badly
scorched, was saved from the conflagration; and
its saving was a piece of good fortune of which
the importance cannot be exaggerated; for without
Maryland Washington could hardly have been
held, and with the national capital in the hands
of the rebels European recognition probably could
not have been prevented. These momentous perils
were in the mind of the administration during
those anxious days, and great indeed was the relief
when the ultimate turn of affairs became assured.
For a week officials in Washington were painfully
taught what it would mean to have Baltimore a
rebel city and Maryland a debatable territory and
battle-ground. For a week Mr. Lincoln and his
advisers lived almost in a state of siege; they were
utterly cut off from communication with the North;
they could get no news; they could not learn what
was doing for their rescue, nor how serious were
the obstructions in the way of such efforts; in place
of correct information they heard only the most
alarming rumors. In a word, they were governing
a country to which they really had no access. The
<!-- Image No 288 --><a name='Png288'></a><a name='Page262'></a><span class="pagenum">262</span>
tension of those days was awful; and it was with
infinite comfort that they became certain that,
whatever other strain might come, this one at
least could not be repeated. Henceforth the loyalty
of Maryland, so carefully nurtured, gradually
grew in strength to the end. Many individuals
long remained in their hearts disloyal, and thousands<a name='FNanchor_137_139'></a><a href='#Footnote_137_139'><sup>[137]</sup></a>

joined the Confederate ranks; but they
had to leave their State in order to get beneath a
secessionist standard, for Maryland was distinctly
and conclusively in the Union.</p>

<p>The situation, resources, and prestige of Virginia
made her next to Maryland in importance among
the doubtful States. Her Unionists were numerically
preponderant; and accordingly the convention,
which assembled early in January, was opposed
to secession by the overwhelming majority
of 89 to 45. But the Secessionists here as elsewhere
in the South were propagandists, fiery with
enthusiasm and energy, and they controlled the
community although they were outnumbered by
those who held, in a more quiet way, contrary
opinions. When the decisive conflict came it was
short and sharp and carried with a rush. By intrigue,
by menace, by passionate appeals seasonably
applied with sudden intensity of effort at the time
of the assault upon Sumter, the convention was
induced to pass an ordinance of secession. Those
who could not bring themselves to vote in the
<!-- Image No 289 --><a name='Png289'></a><a name='Page263'></a><span class="pagenum">263</span>
affirmative were told that they might &quot;absent
themselves or be hanged.&quot; On the other hand,
there were almost no lines along which the President
could project any influence into the State to
encourage the Union sentiment. He sought an interview
with a political leader, but the gentleman
only sent a substitute, and the colloquy amounted
to nothing. He fell in with the scheme of General
Scott concerning Robert E. Lee, which might
have saved Virginia; but this also miscarried.
General Lee has always been kindly spoken of at
the North, whether deservedly or not is a matter not
to be discussed here. Only a few bare facts and
dates can be given: April 17, by a vote of 88 to
55, the dragooned convention passed an &quot;ordinance
to repeal the ratification of the Constitution of
the United States,&quot; but provided that this action
should for the present be kept secret, and that it
might be annulled by the people at a popular voting,
which should be had upon it on the fourth
Thursday in May. The injunction of secrecy was
immediately broken, and before the polls were to
be opened for the balloting Virginia was held by
the military forces of the Confederacy, so that the
vote was a farce. April 18 Mr. F.P. Blair, Jr.,
had an interview in Washington with Lee, in which
he intimated to Lee that the President and General
Scott designed to place him in command of the
army which had just been summoned.<a name='FNanchor_138_140'></a><a href='#Footnote_138_140'><sup>[138]</sup></a>
 Accounts
<!-- Image No 290 --><a name='Png290'></a><a name='Page264'></a><span class="pagenum">264</span>
of this conversation, otherwise inconsistent, all
agree that Lee expressed himself as opposed to
secession,<a name='FNanchor_139_141'></a><a href='#Footnote_139_141'><sup>[139]</sup></a>
 but as unwilling to occupy the position
designed for him, because he &quot;could take no part
in an invasion of the Southern States.&quot; April 20
he tendered his resignation of his commission in
the army, closing with the words, &quot;Save in defense
of my native State, I never desire again to draw
my sword.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_140_142'></a><a href='#Footnote_140_142'><sup>[140]</sup></a>
 On April 22-23 he was appointed
to, and accepted, the command of the state forces.
In so accepting he said: &quot;I devote myself to the
service of my native State, in whose behalf alone
will I ever again draw my sword.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_141_143'></a><a href='#Footnote_141_143'><sup>[141]</sup></a>
 April 24 a
military league was formed between Virginia and
the Confederate States, and her forces were placed
under the command of Jefferson Davis; also an
invitation was given, and promptly accepted, to
make Richmond the Confederate capital. May
16 Virginia formally entered the Confederacy, and
Lee became a general&mdash;the third in rank&mdash;in the
service of the Confederate States, though the secession
of his State was still only inchoate and might
<!-- Image No 291 --><a name='Png291'></a><a name='Page265'></a><span class="pagenum">265</span>
never become complete, since the day set for the
popular vote had not arrived, and it was still a
possibility that the Unionists might find courage
to go to the polls. Thus a rapid succession of
events settled it that the President could save
neither Virginia nor Robert E. Lee for the Union.
Yet the failure was not entire. The northwestern
counties were strongly Union in their proclivities,
and soon followed to a good end an evil example;
for they in turn seceded from Virginia, established
a state government, sought admission into the
Union, and became the State of West Virginia.</p>

<p>Next in order of importance came Kentucky.
The Secessionists, using here the tactics so successful
in other States, endeavored to drive through
by rush and whirl a formal act of secession. But
the Unionists of Kentucky were of more resolute
and belligerent temper than those of Georgia and
Virginia, and would not submit to be swept away
by a torrent really of less volume than their own.<a name='FNanchor_142_144'></a><a href='#Footnote_142_144'><sup>[142]</sup></a>

Yet in spite of the spirited head thus made by the
loyalists the condition in the State long remained
such as to require the most skillful treatment by
the President; during several critical weeks one
error of judgment, a single imprudence, upon his
part might have proved fatal. For the condition
was anomalous and perplexing, and the conflict
of opinion in the State had finally led to the
<!-- Image No 292 --><a name='Png292'></a><a name='Page266'></a><span class="pagenum">266</span>
evolution of a theory or scheme of so-called &quot;neutrality.&quot;
A similar notion had been imperfectly
developed in Maryland, when her legislature declared
that she would take no part in a war. The
idea was illogical to the point of absurdity, for by
it the &quot;neutral&quot; State would at once stay in the
Union and stand aloof from it. Neutrality really
signified a refusal to perform those obligations
which nevertheless were admitted to be binding,
and it made of the State a defensive barrier for
the South, not to be traversed by Northern troops
on an errand of hostility against Confederate Secessionists.
It was practical &quot;non-coercion&quot; under
a name of fairer sound, and it involved the
inconsequence of declaring that the dissolution of
an indissoluble Union should not be prevented; it
was the proverbial folly of being &quot;for the law but
ag'in the enforcement of it.&quot; In the words of a
resolution passed by a public meeting in Louisville:
it was the &quot;duty&quot; of Kentucky to maintain
her &quot;independent position,&quot; taking sides neither
with the administration nor with the seceding
States, &quot;<i>but with the Union against them both</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, though both logic and geography
made neutrality impracticable, yet at least the
desire to be neutral indicated a wavering condition,
and therefore it was Mr. Lincoln's task so to
arrange matters that, when the State should at last
see that it could by no possibility avoid casting its
lot with one side or the other, it should cast it with
the North. For many weeks the two Presidents
<!-- Image No 293 --><a name='Png293'></a><a name='Page267'></a><span class="pagenum">267</span>
played the game for this invaluable stake with all
the tact and skill of which each was master. It
proved to be a repetition of the fable of the sun
and the wind striving to see which could the better
make the traveler take off his cloak, and fortunately
the patience of Mr. Lincoln represented
the warmth of the sun. He gave the Kentuckians
time to learn by observation and the march of
events that neutrality was an impossibility, also to
determine with which side lay the probable advantages
for themselves; also he respected the borders
of the State during its sensitive days, though
in doing so he had to forego some military advantages
of time and position. Deliberation brought
a sound conclusion. Kentucky never passed an
ordinance of secession, but maintained her representation
in Congress and contributed her quota
to the armies; and these invaluable results were
largely due to this wise policy of the President.
Many of her citizens, of course, fought upon the
Southern side, as was the case in all these debatable
Border States, where friends and even families
divided against each other, and each man placed
himself according to his own convictions. It may
seem, therefore, in view of this individual independence
of action, that the ordinance of secession
was a formality which would not have greatly
affected practical conditions; and many critics of
Mr. Lincoln at the time could not appreciate the
value of his &quot;border-state policy,&quot; and thought
that he was making sacrifices and paying prices
<!-- Image No 294 --><a name='Png294'></a><a name='Page268'></a><span class="pagenum">268</span>
wholly against wisdom, and out of proportion to
anything that could be gained thereby. But he
understood the situation and comparative values
correctly. Loyalty to the State governed multitudes;
preference of the State over the United
States cost the nation vast numbers of would-be
Unionists in the seceding States, and in fact made
secession possible; and the same feeling, erroneous
though it was from the Unionist point of view,
yet saved for the Unionist party very great numbers
in these doubtful States which never in fact
seceded. Mr. Davis appreciated this just as much
as Mr. Lincoln did; both were shrewd men, and
were wasting no foolish efforts when they strove
so hard to carry or to prevent formal state action.
They appreciated very well that success in passing
an ordinance would gain for the South throngs of
adherents whose allegiance was, by their peculiar
political creed, due to the winner in this local contest.</p>

<p>In Tennessee the Unionist majority, as indicated
early in February, was overwhelming. Out of a
total vote of less than 92,000, more than 67,000
opposed a state convention. The mountaineers of
the eastern region especially were stalwart loyalists,
and later held to their faith through the
severe ordeal of a peculiarly cruel invasion. But
the political value of these scattered settlements
was small; and in the more populous parts the
Secessionists pursued their usual aggressive and
enterprising tactics with success. Ultimately the
<!-- Image No 295 --><a name='Png295'></a><a name='Page269'></a><span class="pagenum">269</span>
governor and the legislature despotically compelled
secession. It was not decreed by a popular
vote, not even by a convention, but by votes of
the legislature cast in secret session, a proceeding
clearly <i>ultra vires</i> of that body. Finally, on June
8, when a popular vote was taken, the State was
in the military control of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>Very similar was the case of North Carolina.
The people of the uplands, like their neighbors of
Tennessee, were Unionists, and in the rest of the
State there was a prevalent Union sentiment; but
the influence of the political leaders, their direct
usurpations of power, and the customary energetic
propagandism, ultimately won. After a convention
had been once voted down by popular vote, a
second effort to bring one together was successfully
made, and an ordinance of secession was passed
on May 20. Arkansas was swept along with the
stream, seceding on May 6, although prior to that
time the votes both for holding a state convention
and afterward in the convention itself had shown
a decided Unionist preponderance. These three
States, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Arkansas,
were entirely beyond the reach of the President.
He had absolutely no lines of influence along which
he could work to restrain or to guide them.</p>

<p>Missouri had a career peculiar to herself. In
St. Louis there was a strong Unionist majority,
and especially the numerous German population
was thoroughly anti-slavery, and was vigorously
led by F.P. Blair, Jr. But away from her riverfront
<!-- Image No 296 --><a name='Png296'></a><a name='Page270'></a><span class="pagenum">270</span>
the State had a sparse population preserving
the rough propensities of frontiersmen; these men
were not unevenly divided between loyalty and
secession and they were an independent, fighting
set of fellows, each one of whom intended to follow
his own fancy. The result was that Missouri
for a long while carried on a little war of her own
within her own borders, on too large a scale to
be called &quot;bushwhacking,&quot; and yet with a strong
flavor of that irregular style of conflict. The President
interested himself a good deal in the early
efforts of the loyalists, and amid a puzzling snarl
of angry &quot;personal politics&quot; he tried to extend to
them aid and countenance, though with imperfect
success. It was fortunate that Missouri was away
on the outskirts, for she was the most vexatious
and perplexing part of the country. Her population
had little feeling of state allegiance, or, indeed,
of any allegiance at all, but what small
amount there was fell upon the side of the Union;
for though the governor and a majority of the
legislature declared for secession, yet the state
convention voted for the Union by a large majority.
It is true that a sham convention passed a sham
ordinance, but this had no weight with any except
those who were already Secessionists.</p>

<p>Thus by the close of May, 1861, President Lincoln
looked forth upon a spectacle tolerably definite
at last, and certainly as depressing as ever
met the eyes of a great ruler. Eleven States,
with area, population, and resources abundant for
<!-- Image No 297 --><a name='Png297'></a><a name='Page271'></a><span class="pagenum">271</span>
constituting a powerful nation and sustaining an
awful war, were organized in rebellion; their
people were welded into entire unity of feeling,
were enthusiastically resolute, and were believed to
be exceptionally good fighters. The population of
three Border States was divided between loyalty
and disloyalty. The Northern States, teeming
with men and money, had absolutely no experience
whatsoever to enable them to utilize their
vast resources with the promptitude needful in the
instant emergency. There was a notion, prevalent
even among themselves, that they were by temperament
not very well fitted for war; but this
fancy Mr. Lincoln quietly set aside, knowing better.
He also had confidence in the efficiency of
Northern men in practical affairs of any kind
whatsoever, and he had not to tax his patience to
see this confidence vindicated. His appeal for
military support seemed the marvelous word of
a magician, and wrought instant transformation
throughout the vast loyal territory. One half of
the male population began to practice the manual,
to drill, and to study the text-books of military
science; the remainder put at least equal energy
into the preparations for equipment; every manufacturer
in the land set the proverbial Yankee
enterprise and ingenuity at work in the adaptation
of his machinery to the production of munitions of
war and all the various outfit for troops. Every
foundry, every mill, and every shipyard was at
once diverted from its accustomed industries in
<!-- Image No 298 --><a name='Png298'></a><a name='Page272'></a><span class="pagenum">272</span>
order to supply military demands; patriotism and
profit combined to stimulate sleepless toil and invention.
In a hard-working community no one
had ever before worked nearly so hard as now.
The whole North was in a ferment, and every human
being strained his abilities of mind and of
body to the utmost in one serviceable direction
or another; the wise and the foolish, the men of
words and the men of deeds, the projectors of
valuable schemes and the venders of ridiculous
inventions, the applicants for military commissions
and the seekers after the government's contracts,
all hustled and crowded each other in feverish
eagerness to get at work in the new condition of
things. It was going to take time for all this
energy to produce results,&mdash;yet not a very long
time; the President had more patience than would
be needed, and the spirit of his people reassured
him. If the lukewarm, compromising temper of
the past winter had caused him to feel any lurking
anxious doubts as to how the crisis would be met,
such illusive mists were now cleared away in a moment
before the sweeping gale of patriotism.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h2>A REAL PRESIDENT, AND NOT A REAL BATTLE</h2>

<p>The capture of Fort Sumter and the call for
troops established one fact. There was to be a
war. The period of speculation was over and the
period of action had begun. The transition meant
much. The talking men of the country had not
appeared to advantage during the few months in
which they had been busy chiefly in giving weak
advice and in concocting prophecies. They now
retired before the men of affairs, who were to do
better. To the Anglo-Saxon temperament it was
a relief to have done with waiting and to begin to
do something. Activity cleared the minds of men,
and gave to each his appropriate duty.</p>

<p>The gravity of the crisis being undeniable, the
people of the North queried, with more anxiety
than ever before, as to what kind of a chief they
had taken to carry them through it. But the question
which all asked none could answer. Mr. Lincoln
had achieved a good reputation as a politician
and a stump speaker. Whatever a few might
<i>think</i>, this was all that any one <i>knew</i>. The narrow
limitations of his actual experience certainly did
not encourage a belief in his probable fitness to
<!-- Image No 300 --><a name='Png300'></a><a name='Page274'></a><span class="pagenum">274</span>
encounter duties more varied, pressing, numerous,
novel, and difficult than had ever come so suddenly
to confound any ruler within recorded time. Later
on, when it was seen with what rare capacity he
met demands so exacting, many astonished and excitable
observers began to cry out that he was inspired.
This, however, was sheer nonsense. That
the very peculiar requirements of these four years
found a president so well responding to them may
be fairly regarded, by those who so please, as a
specific Providential interference,&mdash;a striking one
among many less striking. But, in fact, nothing
in Mr. Lincoln's life requires, for its explanation,
the notion of divine inspiration. His doings, one
and all, were perfectly intelligible as the outcome
of honesty of purpose, strong common sense, clear
reasoning powers, and a singular sagacity in reading
the popular mind. Intellectually speaking, a
clear and vigorous thinking capacity was his chief
trait. This sounds commonplace and uninteresting,
but a more serviceable qualification could not
have been given him. The truth is, that it was
part of the good fortune of the country that the
President was not a brilliant man. Moreover, he
was cool, shrewd, dispassionate, and self-possessed,
and was endowed really in an extraordinary degree
with an intermingling of patience and courage,
whereby he was enabled both to await and to endure
results. Above all he was a masterful man;
not all the time and in small matters, and not
often in an opinionated way; but, from beginning
<!-- Image No 301 --><a name='Png301'></a><a name='Page275'></a><span class="pagenum">275</span>
to end, whenever he saw fit to be master, master
he was.<a name='FNanchor_143_145'></a><a href='#Footnote_143_145'><sup>[143]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>This last fact, when it became known, answered
another question which people were asking: In
whose hands were the destinies of the North to be?
In those of Mr. Lincoln? or in those of the cabinet?
or in those of influential advisers, something
like what have been called &quot;favorites&quot; in Europe,
and &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot; in the more homely phrase
of the United States? The early impression was
that Mr. Lincoln did not know a great deal. How
could he? Where and how could he have learned
much? It must be admitted that it was entirely
natural that his advisers, and other influential
men concerned in public affairs, should adopt and
act upon the theory that Mr. Lincoln, emerging
so sharply from such a past as his had been, into
such a crisis as was now present, must need a vast
amount of instruction, guidance, suggestion. Accordingly
there were many gentlemen who stood
ready, not to say eager, to supply these fancied
wants, and who could have supplied them very
well had they existed. Therefore one of the first
things which Mr. Lincoln had to do was, without
antagonizing Mr. Seward and Mr. Chase, to indicate
to them that they were to be not only in name
but also in rigid fact his secretaries, and that he
was in fact as well as by title President. This
<!-- Image No 302 --><a name='Png302'></a><a name='Page276'></a><span class="pagenum">276</span>
delicate business was done so soon as opportunity
offered, not in any disguised way but with plain
simplicity. Mr. Chase never took the disposition
quite pleasantly. He managed his department
with splendid ability, but in the personal relation
of a cabinet adviser upon the various matters of
governmental policy he was always somewhat uncomfortable
to get along with, inclined to fault-finding,
ever ready with discordant suggestions,
and in time also disturbed by ambition.</p>

<p>Mr. Seward behaved far better. After the
question of supremacy had been settled, though in
a way quite contrary to his anticipation, he frankly
accepted the subordinate position, and discharged
his duties with hearty good-will. Indeed, this settlement
had already come, before the time which
this narrative has reached; but the people did
not know it; it was a private matter betwixt the
two men who had been parties to it. Only Mr.
Lincoln and Mr. Seward knew that the secretary
had suggested his willingness to run the government
for the President, and that the President
had replied that he intended to run it himself.
It came about in this way: on April 1 Mr. Seward
presented, in writing, &quot;Some thoughts for the
President's consideration.&quot; He opened with the
statement, not conciliatory, that &quot;We are at the
end of a month's administration, and yet without
a policy, either domestic or foreign.&quot; He then
proceeded to offer suggestions for each. For the
&quot;policy at home&quot; he proposed, as the &quot;ruling
<!-- Image No 303 --><a name='Png303'></a><a name='Page277'></a><span class="pagenum">277</span>
idea:&quot; &quot;Change the question before the public
from one upon slavery, or about slavery, for a question
upon Union or Disunion.&quot; It was odd and
not complimentary that he should seem to forget
or ignore that precisely this thing had already
been attempted by Mr. Lincoln in his inaugural
address. Also within a few days, as we all know
now, events were to show that the attempt had
been successful. Further comment upon the domestic
policy of Mr. Seward is, therefore, needless.
But his scheme &quot;For Foreign Nations&quot; is more
startling:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;I would demand explanations from Spain and
France categorically at once.</p>

<p>&quot;I would seek explanations from Great Britain
and Russia, and send agents into Canada, Mexico,
and Central America, to rouse a vigorous spirit of
independence on this continent against European
intervention.</p>

<p>&quot;And, if satisfactory explanations are not received
from Spain and France,</p>

<p>&quot;Would convene Congress and declare war
against them.</p>

<p>&quot;But whatever policy we adopt, there must be
an energetic prosecution of it.</p>

<p>&quot;For this purpose it must be somebody's business
to pursue and direct it incessantly.</p>

<p>&quot;Either the President must do it himself, and
be all the while active in it, or</p>

<p>&quot;Devolve it on some member of his cabinet.</p>

<p>&quot;Once adopted, debates on it must end, and all
agree and abide.</p>

<p>&quot;<!-- Image No 304 --><a name='Png304'></a><a name='Page278'></a><span class="pagenum">278</span>
It is not in my especial province.</p>

<p>&quot;But I neither seek to evade nor assume responsibility.&quot;</p>

<p>Suggestions so wild could not properly constitute
material for &quot;consideration&quot; by the President;
but much consideration on the part of students
of those times and men is provoked by the
fact that such counsel emanated from such a source.
The secretary of state, heretofore the most distinguished
leader in the great Republican movement,
who should by merit of actual achievement
have been the Republican candidate for the presidency,
and who was expected by a large part of
the country to save an ignorant president from
bad blunders, was advancing a proposition to create
pretexts whereby to force into existence a foreign
war upon a basis which was likely to set one
half of the civilized world against the other half.
The purpose for which he was willing to do this
awful thing was: to paralyze for a while domestic
discussions, and to undo and leave to be done anew
by the next generation all that vast work which he
himself, and the President whom he advised, and
the leaders of the great multitude whom they both
represented, had for years been engaged in prosecuting
with all the might that was in them. But
the explanation is simple: like many another at
that trying moment, the secretary was smitten
with sudden panic at the condition which had been
brought about so largely by his own efforts. It
was strictly a panic, for it passed away rapidly as
panics do.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 305 --><a name='Png305'></a><a name='Page279'></a><span class="pagenum">279</span>
The biographer of Mr. Seward may fairly
enough glide lightly over this episode, since it was
nothing more than an episode; but one who writes
of Mr. Lincoln must, in justice, call attention to
this spectacle of the sage statesman from whom,
if from any one, this &quot;green hand,&quot; this inexperienced
President, must seek guidance, thus in
deliberate writing pointing out a course which was
ridiculous and impossible, and which, if it had been
possible, would have been an intolerably humiliating
retreat. The anxious people, who thought
that their untried President might, upon the worst
estimate of his own abilities, get on fairly well by
the aid of wise and skilled advisers, would have
been aghast had they known that, inside of the
government, the pending question was: not whether
Mr. Lincoln would accept sound instruction, but
whether he would have sense to recognize bad
advice, and independence to reject it. Before Mr.
Seward went to bed on that night of April 1, he
was perhaps the only man in the country who
knew the solution of this problem. But he knew
it, for Mr. Lincoln had already answered his letter.
It had not taken the President long! The secretary's
extraordinary offer to assume the responsibility
of pursuing and directing the policy of the
government was rejected within a few hours after
it was made; rejected not offensively, but briefly,
clearly, decisively, and without thanks. Concerning
the proposed policies, domestic and foreign,
the President said as little as was called for; he
<!-- Image No 306 --><a name='Png306'></a><a name='Page280'></a><span class="pagenum">280</span>
actually did not even refer to the scheme for inaugurating
gratuitously a war with a large part of
Europe, in order for a while to distract attention
from slavery.</p>

<p>To us, to-day, it seems that the President could
not have missed a course so obvious; yet Mr.
Seward, who suggested the absurdity, was a great
statesman. In truth, the President had shown not
only sense but nerve. For the difference between
Seward's past opportunities and experience and
his own was appreciated by him as fully as by any
one. He knew perfectly well that what seemed
the less was controlling what seemed the greater
when he overruled his secretary. It took courage
on the part of a thoughtful man to put himself
in such a position. Other solemn reflections also
could not be avoided. Not less interested than
any other citizen in the fate of the nation, he had
also a personal relation to the ultimate event which
was exclusively his own. For he himself might
be called, in a certain sense, the very cause of rebellion;
of course the people who had elected him
carried the real responsibility; but he stood as the
token of the difference, the concrete provocation
to the fight. The South had said: <i>Abraham Lincoln</i>
brings secession. It was frightful to think
that, as he was in fact the signal, so posterity
might mistake him for the very cause of the rending
of a great nation, the failure of a grand experiment.
It might be that this destiny was before
him, for the outcome of this struggle no one could
<!-- Image No 307 --><a name='Png307'></a><a name='Page281'></a><span class="pagenum">281</span>
foretell; it might be his sad lot to mark the end of
the line of Presidents of the United States. Lincoln
was not a man who could escape the full
weight of these reflections, and it is to be remembered
that all actions were taken beneath that
weight. It was a strong man, then, who stood up
and said, This is my load and I will carry it; and
who did carry it, when others offered to shift much
of it upon their own shoulders; also who would
not give an hour's thought to a scheme which promised
to lift it away entirely, and to leave it for
some other who by and by should come after him.</p>

<p>It is worth while to remember that Mr. Lincoln
was the most advised man, often the worst advised
man, in the annals of mankind. The torrent must
have been terribly confusing! Another instance
deserves mention: shortly before Mr. Seward's
strange proposal, Governor Hicks, distracted at
the tumult in Maryland, had suggested that the
quarrel between North and South should be referred
to Lord Lyons as arbitrator! It was difficult
to know whether to be amused or resentful
before a proposition at once so silly and so ignominious.
Yet it came from an important official,
and it was only one instance among thousands.
With war as an actuality, such vagaries as those
of Hicks and Seward came sharply to an end.
People wondered and talked somewhat as to how
long hostilities would last, how much they would
cost, how they would end; and were not more correct
in these speculations than they had been in
<!-- Image No 308 --><a name='Png308'></a><a name='Page282'></a><span class="pagenum">282</span>
others. But though the day of gross absurdities
was over, the era of advice endured permanently.
That peculiar national trait whereby every American
knows at least as much on every subject
whatsoever as is known by any other living man,
produced its full results during the war. Every
clergyman and humanitarian, every village politician
and every city wire-puller, every one who
conned the maps of Virginia and imbibed the military
wisdom of the newspapers, every merchant
who put his name to a subscription paper, considered
it his privilege and his duty to set the President
right upon every question of moral principle,
of politics, of strategy, and of finance. In one
point of view it was not flattering that he should
seem to stand in need of so much instruction; and
this was equally true whether it came bitterly, as
criticism from enemies, or sugar-coated, as advice
from friends. That friends felt obliged to advise
so much was in itself a criticism. Probably, however,
Mr. Lincoln was not troubled by this view,
for he keenly appreciated the idiosyncrasies as
well as the better qualities of the people. They,
however, were a long while in understanding him
sufficiently to recognize that there was never a
man whom it was less worth while to advise.</p>

<hr class='short'/>

<p>Business crowded upon Mr. Lincoln, and the
variety and novelty of it was without limit. On
April 17 Jefferson Davis issued a proclamation
offering &quot;letters of marque and reprisal&quot; to owners
<!-- Image No 309 --><a name='Png309'></a><a name='Page283'></a><span class="pagenum">283</span>
of private armed vessels. Two days later the
President retorted by proclaiming a blockade of
Confederate ports.<a name='FNanchor_144_146'></a><a href='#Footnote_144_146'><sup>[144]</sup></a>
 Of course this could not be
made effective upon the moment. On March 4
the nominal total of vessels in the navy was 90.
Of these, 69 were classed as &quot;available;&quot; but only
42 were actually in commission; and even of these
many were in Southern harbors, and fell into the
hands of the Confederates; many more were upon
foreign and distant stations. Indeed, the dispersion
was so great that it was commonly charged as
having been intentionally arranged by secessionist
officials under Mr. Buchanan. Also, at the very
moment when this proclamation was being read
throughout the country, the great navy yard of
Gosport, at Norfolk, Virginia, &quot;always the favored
depot&quot; of the government, with all its workshops
and a great store of cannon and other munitions,
was passing into the hands of the enemy.
Most of the vessels and some other property
were destroyed by Federals before the seizure was
consummated; nevertheless, the loss was severe.
Moreover, even had all the vessels of the regular
navy been present, they would have had other duties
besides lying off Southern ports. Blockading
squadrons, therefore, had to be improvised, and
orders at once issued for the purchase and equipment
of steam vessels from the merchant marine
<!-- Image No 310 --><a name='Png310'></a><a name='Page284'></a><span class="pagenum">284</span>
and the coasting service. Fortunately the summer
season was at hand, so that these makeshifts
were serviceable for many months, during which
better craft were rapidly got together by alteration
and building. Three thousand miles of coast and
many harbors were included within the blockade
limits, and were distributed into departments under
different commanders. Each commander was
instructed to declare his blockade in force as soon
as he felt able to make it tolerably effective, with
the expectation of rapidly improving its efficiency.
The beginning was, therefore, ragged, and was
naturally criticised in a very jealous and hostile
spirit by those foreign nations who suffered by it.
Dangerous disputes threatened to arise, but were
fortunately escaped, and in a surprisingly short
time &quot;Yankee&quot; enterprise made the blockade too
thorough for question.</p>

<p>Amid the first haste and pressure it was ingeniously
suggested that, since the government
claimed jurisdiction over the whole country and
recognized only a rebellion strictly so called, therefore
the President could by proclamation simply
<i>close</i> ports at will. Secretary Welles favored this
course, and in the extra session of the summer of
1861 Congress passed a bill giving authority to
Mr. Lincoln to pursue it, in his discretion. Mr.
Seward, with better judgment, said that it might
be legal, but would certainly be unwise. The position
probably could have been successfully maintained
by lawyers before a bench of judges; but
<!-- Image No 311 --><a name='Png311'></a><a name='Page285'></a><span class="pagenum">285</span>
to have relied upon it in the teeth of the commercial
interests and unfriendly sentiment of England
and France would have been a fatal blunder.
Happily it was avoided; and the President had
the shrewdness to keep within a line which shut
out technical discussion. Already he saw that, so
far as relations with foreigners were concerned,
the domestic theory of a rebellion, pure and simple,
must be very greatly modified. In a word,
that which began as rebellion soon developed into
civil war; the two were closely akin, but with
some important differences.</p>

<p>Nice points of domestic constitutional law also
arose with the first necessity for action, opening
the broad question as to what course should be
pursued in doubtful cases, and worse still in those
cases where the government could not fairly claim
the benefit of a real doubt. The plain truth was
that, in a condition faintly contemplated in the
Constitution, many things not permitted by the
Constitution must be done to preserve the Constitution.
The present crisis had been very scantily
and vaguely provided for by &quot;the fathers.&quot; The
instant that action became necessary to save the
Union under the Constitution, it was perfectly obvious
that the Constitution must be stretched, transcended,
and most liberally interlined, in a fashion
which would furnish annoying arguments to the
disaffected. The President looked over the situation,
and decided, in the proverbial phrase, to take
the bull by the horns; that which clearly ought to
<!-- Image No 312 --><a name='Png312'></a><a name='Page286'></a><span class="pagenum">286</span>
be done he would do, law or no law, doubt or no
doubt. He would have faith that the people would
sustain him; and that the courts and the lawyers,
among whose functions it is to see to it that laws
and statutes do not interfere too seriously with
the convenience of the community, would arrive,
in what subtle and roundabout way they might
choose, at the conclusion that whatever must be
done might be done. These learned gentlemen
did their duty, and developed the &quot;war powers&quot;
under the Constitution in a manner equally ingenious,
comical, and sensible. But the fundamental
basis was, that necessity knows no law; every man
in the country knew this, but the well-intentioned
denied it, as matter of policy, while the ill-intentioned
made such use of the opportunities thus
afforded to them as might have been expected.
Among the &quot;war Democrats,&quot; however, there was
at least ostensible liberality.</p>

<p>An early question related to the writ of habeas
corpus. The Maryland legislature was to meet
on April 26, 1861, and was expected to guide the
State in the direction of secession. Many influential
men urged the President to arrest the members
before they could do this. He, however, conceived
such an interference with a state government, in
the present condition of popular feeling, to be impolitic.
&quot;We cannot know in advance,&quot; he said,
&quot;that the action will not be lawful and peaceful;&quot;
and he instructed General Scott to watch them,
and, in case they should make a movement towards
<!-- Image No 313 --><a name='Png313'></a><a name='Page287'></a><span class="pagenum">287</span>
arraying the people against the United States, to
counteract it by &quot;the bombardment of their cities,
and, in the extremest necessity, the suspension of
the writ of habeas corpus.&quot; This intimation that
the suspension of the venerated writ was a measure
graver than even bombarding a city, surely indicated
sufficient respect for laws and statutes. The
legislators restrained their rebellious ardor and
proved the wisdom of Mr. Lincoln's moderation.
In the autumn, however, the crisis recurred, and
then the arrests seemed the only means of preventing
the passage of an ordinance of secession.
Accordingly the order was issued and executed.
Public opinion upheld it, and Governor Hicks
afterward declared his belief that only by this action
had Maryland been saved from destruction.</p>

<p>The privilege of habeas corpus could obviously,
however, be made dangerously serviceable to disaffected
citizens. Therefore, April 27, the President
instructed General Scott: &quot;If at any point
on or in the vicinity of any military line which is
now, or which shall be, used between the city of
Philadelphia and the city of Washington, you find
it necessary to suspend the writ of habeas corpus
for the public safety, you ... are authorized to
suspend that writ.&quot; Several weeks elapsed before
action was taken under this authority. Then, on
May 25, John Merryman, recruiting in Maryland
for the Confederate service, was seized and imprisoned
in Fort McHenry. Chief Justice Taney
granted a writ of habeas corpus. General Cadwalader
<!-- Image No 314 --><a name='Png314'></a><a name='Page288'></a><span class="pagenum">288</span>
replied that he held Merryman upon a
charge of treason, and that he had authority under
the President's letter to suspend the writ. The
chief justice thereupon issued against the general
an attachment for contempt, but the marshal was
refused admittance to the fort. The chief justice
then filed with the clerk, and also sent to the President,
his written opinion, in which he said: &quot;I
understand that the President not only claims the
right to suspend the writ of habeas corpus at his
discretion, but to delegate that discretionary power
to a military officer;&quot; whereas, according to the
view of his honor, the power did not lie even with
the President himself, but only with Congress.
Warming to the discussion, he used pretty strong
language, to the effect that, if authority intrusted
to other departments could thus &quot;be usurped by
the military power at its discretion, the people ...
are no longer living under a government of
laws; but every citizen holds life, liberty, and property
at the will and pleasure of the army officer
in whose military district he may happen to be
found.&quot; It was unfortunate that the country
should hear such phrases launched by the chief
justice against the President, or at least against
acts done under orders of the President. Direct
retort was of course impossible, and the dispute
was in abeyance for a short time.<a name='FNanchor_145_147'></a><a href='#Footnote_145_147'><sup>[145]</sup></a>
But the predilections
<!-- Image No 315 --><a name='Png315'></a><a name='Page289'></a><span class="pagenum">289</span>
of the judicial hero of the Dred Scott decision
were such as to give rise to grave doubts as
to whether or not the Union could be saved by any
process which would not often run counter to his
ideas of the law; therefore in this matter the President
continued to exercise the useful and probably
essential power, though taking care, for the
future, to have somewhat more regard for form.
Thus, on May 10, instead of simply writing a
letter, he issued through the State Department a
proclamation authorizing the Federal commander
on the Florida coast, &quot;if he shall find it necessary,
to suspend there the writ of habeas corpus.&quot;</p>

<p>In due time the assembling of Congress gave
Mr. Lincoln the opportunity to present his side of
the case. In his message he said that arrests, and
suspension of the writ, had been made &quot;very sparingly;&quot;
and that, if authority had been stretched,
at least the question was pertinent: &quot;Are all
the laws but one to go unexecuted, and the government
itself to go to pieces, lest that one be
violated?&quot; He, however, believed that in fact this
question was not presented, and that the law had
not been violated. &quot;The provision of the Constitution,
that the privilege of the writ of habeas
corpus shall not be suspended unless when, in
cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety
may require it, is equivalent to a provision that
such privilege may be suspended when, in cases of
<!-- Image No 316 --><a name='Png316'></a><a name='Page290'></a><span class="pagenum">290</span>
rebellion or invasion, the public safety does require
it.&quot; As between Congress and the executive,
&quot;the Constitution itself is silent as to which
or who is to exercise the power; and as the provision
was plainly made for a dangerous emergency
it cannot be believed that the framers of the instrument
intended that in every case the danger
should run its course until Congress could be
called together, the very assembling of which
might be prevented, as was intended in this case
by the rebellion.&quot;</p>

<p>If it was difficult, it was also undesirable to
confute the President's logic. The necessity for
military arrests and for indefinite detention of the
arrested persons was undeniable. Congress therefore
recognized the legality of what had been done,
and the power was frequently exercised thereafter,
and to great advantage. Of course mistakes occurred,
and subordinates made some arrests which
had better have been left unmade; but these bore
only upon discretion in individual cases, not upon
inherent right. The topic, however, was in itself
a tempting one, not only for the seriously disaffected,
but for the far larger body of the quarrelsome,
who really wanted the government to do its
work, yet maliciously liked to make the process
of doing it just as difficult and as disagreeable
as possible. Later on, when the malcontent class
acquired the organization of a distinct political
body, no other charge against the administration
proved so plausible and so continuously serviceable
<!-- Image No 317 --><a name='Png317'></a><a name='Page291'></a><span class="pagenum">291</span>
as this. It invited to florid declamation profusely
illustrated with impressive historical allusions,
and to the free use of vague but grand and
sonorous phrases concerning &quot;usurpation,&quot; &quot;the
subjection of the life, liberty, and property of every
citizen to the mere will of a military commander,&quot;
and other like terrors. Unfortunately men much
more deserving of respect than the Copperheads,
men of sound loyalty and high ability, but of anxious
and conservative temperament, were led by
their fears to criticise severely arrests of men who
were as dangerous to the government as if they had
been soldiers of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>May 3, 1861, by which time military exigencies
had become better understood, Mr. Lincoln called
&quot;into the service of the United States 42,034
volunteers,&quot; and directed that the regular army
should be increased by an aggregate of 22,714
officers and enlisted men. More suggestive than
the mere increase was the fact that the volunteers
were now required &quot;to serve for a period of three
years, unless sooner discharged.&quot; The opinion of
the government as to the magnitude of the task in
hand was thus for the first time conveyed to the
people. They received it seriously and without
faltering.</p>

<p>July 4, 1861, the Thirty-seventh Congress met
in extra session, and the soundness of the President's
judgment in setting a day which had at first
been condemned as too distant was proved. In the
interval, nothing had been lost which could have
<!-- Image No 318 --><a name='Png318'></a><a name='Page292'></a><span class="pagenum">292</span>
been saved by the sitting of Congress; while, on
the other hand, the members had had the great
advantage of having time to think soberly concerning
the business before them, and to learn the
temper and wishes of their constituents.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln took great pains with his message,
which he felt to be a very important document.
It was his purpose to say simply what events had
occurred, what questions had been opened, and
what necessities had arisen; to display the situation
and to state facts fairly and fully, but not
apparently to argue the case of the North. Yet it
was essential for him so to do this that no doubt
could be left as to where the right lay. This
peculiar process of argument by statement had
constituted his special strength at the bar, and he
now gave an excellent instance of it. He briefly
sketched the condition of public affairs at the
time when he assumed the government; he told
the story of Sumter, and of the peculiar process
whereby Virginia had been linked to the Confederacy.
With a tinge of irony he remarked that,
whether the sudden change of feeling among
the members of the Virginian Convention was
&quot;wrought by their great approval of the assault
upon Sumter, or their great resentment at the
government's resistance to that assault, is not definitely
known.&quot;</p>

<p>He explained the effect of the neutrality theory
of the Border States. &quot;This,&quot; he said, &quot;would
be disunion completed. Figuratively speaking, it
<!-- Image No 319 --><a name='Png319'></a><a name='Page293'></a><span class="pagenum">293</span>
would be the building of an impassable wall along
the line of separation,&mdash;and yet not quite an impassable
one, for under the guise of neutrality it
would tie the hands of the Union men, and freely
pass supplies to the insurrectionists.... At a
stroke it would take all the trouble off the hands
of secession, except what proceeds from the external
blockade.&quot; It would give to the disunionists
&quot;disunion, without a struggle of their own.&quot;</p>

<p>Of the blockade and the calls for troops, he
said: &quot;These measures, whether strictly legal or
not, were ventured upon under what appeared to
be a popular demand and a public necessity, trusting
then, as now, that Congress would ratify
them.&quot; At the same time he stated the matter of
the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, which
has been already referred to.</p>

<p>Speaking of the doctrine that secession was
lawful under the Constitution, and that it was not
rebellion, he made plain the genuine significance
of the issue thus raised: &quot;It presents ... the
question whether a Constitutional Republic or
Democracy, a government of the people by the
same people, can or cannot maintain its territorial
integrity against its own domestic foes. It
presents the question whether discontented individuals,
too few in numbers to control the administration
according to the organic law in any case,
can always, upon the pretenses made in this case,
or any other pretenses, or arbitrarily without any
pretense, break up their government, and thus
<!-- Image No 320 --><a name='Png320'></a><a name='Page294'></a><span class="pagenum">294</span>
practically put an end to free government upon
the earth. It forces us to ask: Is there in all
Republics this inherent fatal weakness? Must a
government of necessity be too strong for the liberties
of its own people, or too weak to maintain
its own existence?&quot; The Constitution of the Confederacy
was a paraphrase with convenient adaptations
of the Constitution of the United States.
A significant one of these adaptations was the
striking out of the first three words, &quot;We, the
people,&quot; and the substitution of the words, &quot;We,
the deputies of the sovereign and independent
States.&quot; &quot;Why,&quot; said Mr. Lincoln, &quot;why this
deliberate pressing out of view the rights of men
and the authority of the people? This is essentially
a people's contest. On the side of the
Union it is a struggle for maintaining in the
world that form and substance of government
whose leading object is to elevate the condition of
men ... to afford to all an unfettered start and
a fair chance in the race of life.... This is the
leading object of the government for whose existence
we contend. I am most happy to believe that
the plain people understand and appreciate this.&quot;</p>

<p>Many persons, not gifted with the power of
thinking clearly, were disturbed at what seemed to
them a purpose to &quot;invade&quot; and to &quot;subjugate&quot;
sovereign States,&mdash;as though a government could
invade its own country or subjugate its own subjects!
These phrases, he said, were producing
&quot;uneasiness in the minds of candid men&quot; as to
<!-- Image No 321 --><a name='Png321'></a><a name='Page295'></a><span class="pagenum">295</span>
what would be the course of the government toward
the Southern States after the suppression of the
rebellion. The President assured them that he
had no expectation of changing the views set forth
in his inaugural address; that he desired &quot;to preserve
the government, that it may be administered
for all as it was administered by the men who
made it. Loyal citizens everywhere have a right
to expect this,... and the government has no
right to withhold or neglect it. It is not perceived
that in giving it there is any coercion, any conquest,
or any subjugation.&quot;</p>

<p>In closing he said that it was with the deepest
regret that he had used the war power; but &quot;in
defense of the government, forced upon him, he
could but perform this duty or surrender the existence
of the government.&quot; Compromise would
have been useless, for &quot;no popular government can
long survive a marked precedent that those who
carry an election can only save the government
from immediate destruction by giving up the main
point upon which the people gave the election.&quot;
To those who would have had him compromise he
explained that only the people themselves, not
their servants, can safely reverse their own deliberate
decisions. He had no power to agree to
divide the country which he had the duty to govern.
&quot;As a private citizen the executive could
not have consented that these institutions shall
perish; much less could he, in betrayal of so vast
and so sacred a trust as these free people have
<!-- Image No 322 --><a name='Png322'></a><a name='Page296'></a><span class="pagenum">296</span>
confided to him. He felt that he had no moral
right to shrink, nor even to count the chances of
his own life in what might follow.&quot;</p>

<p>The only direct request made in the message
was that, to make &quot;this contest a short and decisive
one,&quot; Congress would &quot;place at the control of
the government for the work at least 400,000 men,
and $400,000,000. That number of men is about
one tenth of those of proper ages within the regions
where apparently all are willing to engage,
and the sum is less than a twenty-third part of the
money value owned by the men who seem ready to
devote the whole.&quot;</p>

<p>The message was well received by the people, as
it deserved to be.</p>

<p>The proceedings of Congress can only be referred
to with brevity. Yet a mere recital of the
names of the more noteworthy members of the
Senate and the House must be intruded, if merely
for the flavor of reminiscence which it will bring
to readers who recall those times. In the Senate,
upon the Republican side, there were: Lyman
Trumbull from Illinois, James Harlan and James
W. Grimes from Iowa, William P. Fessenden
from Maine, Charles Sumner and Henry Wilson
from Massachusetts, Zachariah Chandler from
Michigan, John P. Hale from New Hampshire,
Benjamin F. Wade from Ohio, and John Sherman,
who was elected to fill the vacancy created
by the appointment of Salmon P. Chase to the
Treasury Department, David Wilmot from Pennsylvania,
<!-- Image No 323 --><a name='Png323'></a><a name='Page297'></a><span class="pagenum">297</span>
filling the place of Simon Cameron,
Henry B. Anthony from Rhode Island, Andrew
Johnson from Tennessee, Jacob Collamer from
Vermont, and James R. Doolittle from Wisconsin.
On the Democratic side, there were: James A.
McDougall of California, James A. Bayard and
William Saulsbury of Delaware, Jesse D. Bright
of Indiana, who was expelled February 5, 1862,
John C. Breckenridge of Kentucky, who a little
later openly joined the Secessionists, and was formally
expelled December 4, 1861; he was succeeded
by Garrett Davis, an &quot;American or Old
Line Whig,&quot; by which name he and two senators
from Maryland preferred to be described; James
W. Nesmith of Oregon. Lane and Pomeroy, the
first senators from the free State of Kansas, were
seated. In the House Galusha A. Grow of Pennsylvania,
who had lately knocked down Mr. Keitt
of South Carolina in a fisticuff encounter on the
floor of the chamber, was chosen speaker, over
Francis P. Blair, Jr., of Missouri. Thaddeus
Stevens of Pennsylvania was the most prominent
man in the body. Among many familiar names
in running down the list the eye lights upon
James E. English of Connecticut; E.B. Washburne,
Isaac N. Arnold, and Owen Lovejoy of Illinois;
Julian, Voorhees, and Schuyler Colfax of
Indiana; Crittenden of Kentucky; Roscoe Conkling,
Reuben E. Fenton, and Erastus Corning of
New York; George H. Pendleton, Vallandigham,
Ashley, Shellabarger, and S.S. Cox of Ohio;
<!-- Image No 324 --><a name='Png324'></a><a name='Page298'></a><span class="pagenum">298</span>
Covode of Pennsylvania; Maynard of Tennessee.
The members came together in very good temper;
and the great preponderance of Republicans secured
dispatch in the conduct of business; for the
cliques which soon produced intestine discomfort
in that dominant party were not yet developed.
No ordinary legislation was entered upon; but in
twenty-nine working days seventy-six public Acts
were passed, of which all but four bore directly
upon the extraordinary emergency. The demands
of the President were met, with additions: 500,000
men and $500,000,000 were voted; $207,000,000
were appropriated to the army, and $56,000,000
to the navy. August 6 Congress adjourned.</p>

<hr class='short'/>

<p>The law-makers were treated, during their session,
to what was regarded, in the inexperience of
those days, as a spectacle of real war. During a
couple of months past large bodies of men had
been gathering together, living in tents, shouldering
guns, and taking the name of armies. General
Butler was in command at Fortress Monroe, and
was faced by Colonel Magruder, who held the
peninsula between the York and the James rivers.
Early in June the lieutenants of these two commanders
performed the comical fiasco of the &quot;battle&quot;
of Big Bethel. In this skirmish the Federal
regiments fired into each other, and then retreated,
while the Confederates withdrew; but in language
of absurd extravagance the Confederate colonel
reported that he had won a great victory, and
<!-- Image No 325 --><a name='Png325'></a><a name='Page299'></a><span class="pagenum">299</span>
Northern men flushed beneath the ridicule incurred
by the blunder of their troops.</p>

<p>A smaller affair at Vienna was more ridiculous;
several hundred soldiers, aboard a train of cars,
started upon a reconnoissance, as if it had been a
picnic. The Confederates fired upon them with
a couple of small cannon, and they hastily took to
the woods. When they got home they talked
wisely about &quot;masked batteries.&quot; But the shrewdness
and humor of the people were not thus turned
aside, and the &quot;masked battery&quot; long made the
point of many a bitter jest.</p>

<p>Up the river, Harper's Ferry was held by
&quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson, who was soon succeeded by
J.E. Johnston. Confronting and watching this
force was General Patterson, at Chambersburg,
Pennsylvania, with a body of men rapidly growing
to considerable numbers by the daily coming of
recruits. Not very far away, southeastward, the
main body of the Confederate army, under Beauregard,
lay at Manassas, and the main body of the
Federal army, under McDowell, was encamped
along the Potomac. On May 23 the Northern advance
crossed that river, took possession of Arlington
Heights and of Alexandria, and began work
upon permanent defensive intrenchments in front
of the capital.</p>

<p>The people of the North knew nothing about
war or armies. Wild with enthusiasm and excitement,
they cheered the departing regiments,
which, as they vaguely and eagerly fancied, were to
<!-- Image No 326 --><a name='Png326'></a><a name='Page300'></a><span class="pagenum">300</span>
begin fighting at once. Yet it was true that no
one would stake his money on a &quot;football team&quot;
which should go into a game trained in a time so
short as that which had been allowed for bringing
into condition for the manoeuvres and battlefields
of a campaign an army of thirty or forty thousand
men, with staff and commissariat, and arms of infantry,
cavalry, and artillery, altogether constituting
an organization vast, difficult, and complex in
the highest degree of human co&ouml;peration. Nevertheless
&quot;On to Richmond!&quot; rolled up the imperious
cry from every part of the North. The government,
either sharing in this madness, or feeling
that it must be yielded to, passed the word to the
commander, and McDowell very reluctantly obeyed
orders and started with his army in that direction,&mdash;not,
however, with any real hope of reaching
this nominal objective; for he was an intelligent
man and a good soldier, and was perfectly aware of
the unfitness of his army. But when, protesting,
he suggested that his troops were &quot;green,&quot; he was
told to remember that the Southern troops were of
the same tint; for, in a word, the North was bound
to have a fight, and would by no means endure
that the three months' men should come home without
doing something more positive than merely
preventing the capture of Washington.</p>

<p>On July 16, therefore, McDowell began his advance,
having with him about 35,000 men, and by
the 19th he was at the stream of Bull Run, behind
which the Confederates lay. He planned his
<!-- Image No 327 --><a name='Png327'></a><a name='Page301'></a><span class="pagenum">301</span>
battle skillfully, and began his attack on the morning
of the 21st. On the other hand, Beauregard
was at the double disadvantage of misapprehending
his opponent's purpose, and of failing to get
his orders conveyed to his lieutenants until the
fight was far advanced. The result was, that at
the beginning of the afternoon the Federals had
almost won a victory which they fully deserved.
That they did not finally secure it was due to the
inefficiency of General Patterson. This general
had crossed the Potomac a few days before and
had been instructed to watch Johnston, who had
drawn back near Winchester, and either to prevent
him from moving his force from the Shenandoah
Valley to Manassas, or, failing this, to keep close
to him and unite with McDowell. But Patterson
neither detained nor followed his opponent. On
July 18 Beauregard telegraphed to Johnston: &quot;If
you wish to help me, now is the time.&quot; If Patterson
wished to help McDowell, then, also, was the
time. The Southern general seized his opportunity,
and the Northern general let his opportunity
go. Johnston, uninterrupted and unfollowed by
Patterson, brought his troops in from Manassas
Junction upon the right wing of the Federals at
the very moment and crisis when the battle was
actually in the process of going in their favor.
Directly all was changed. Older troops would not
have stood, and these untried ones were defeated
as soon as they were attacked. Speedily retreat
became rout, and rout became panic. At a great
<!-- Image No 328 --><a name='Png328'></a><a name='Page302'></a><span class="pagenum">302</span>
speed the frightened soldiers, resolved into a mere
disorganized mob of individuals, made their way
back to the camps on the Potomac; many thought
Washington safer, and some did not stop short of
their distant Northern homes.</p>

<p>The Southerners, who had been on the point of
running away when the Northerners anticipated
them in so doing, now triumphed immoderately,
and uttered boastings magniloquent enough for
Homeric heroes. Yet they were, as General Johnston
said, &quot;almost as much disorganized by victory
as were the Federals by defeat.&quot; Many of them
also hastened to their homes, spreading everywhere
the cheering tidings that the war was over and the
South had won.</p>

<p>In point of fact, it was a stage of the war when
defeat was more wholesome than victory. Fortunately,
too, the North was not even momentarily
discouraged. The people had sense enough to see
that what had happened was precisely what should
have been expected. A little humiliated at their
own folly, about as much vexed with themselves
as angry with their enemies, they turned to their
work in a new spirit. Persistence displaced excitement,
as three years' men replaced three months'
men. The people settled down to a long, hard
task. Besides this, they had now some idea of
what was necessary to be done in order to succeed
in that task. Invaluable lessons had been learned,
and no lives which were lost in the war bore fruit
of greater usefulness than did those which seemed
to have been foolishly thrown away at Bull Run.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h2>THE FIRST ACT OF THE MCCLELLAN DRAMA</h2>

<p>On the day after the battle of Bull Run General
George B. McClellan was summoned to Washington,
where he arrived on July 26. On the 25th
he had been assigned to the command of the army
of the Potomac. By all the light which President
Lincoln had at the time of making this appointment,
it seemed the best that was possible;
and in fact it was so, in view of the immediate
sphere of usefulness of a commanding general in
Virginia. McClellan was thirty-four years old, of
vigorous physique and fine address. After his
graduation at West Point, in 1846, he was attached
to the Engineer Corps; he served through the
Mexican war, and for merit received a captaincy.
In 1855 he was sent by Jefferson Davis, then secretary
of war, to Europe to study the organizing
and handling of armies in active service; and he
was for a while at the British headquarters during
the siege of Sebastopol, observing their system in
operation. In January, 1857, he resigned from
the army; but with the first threatenings of the
civil war he made ready to play an active part.
April 23, 1861, he was appointed by the governor
<!-- Image No 330 --><a name='Png330'></a><a name='Page304'></a><span class="pagenum">304</span>
of Ohio a major-general, with command of all
the state forces. May 13, by an order from the
national government, he took command of the
Department of the Ohio, in which shortly afterward
Western Virginia was included. He found
the sturdy mountaineers of this inaccessible region
for the most part loyalists, but overawed by rebel
troops, and toward the close of May, upon his own
sole responsibility, he inaugurated a campaign for
their relief. In this he had the good fortune to be
entirely successful. By some small engagements
he cleared the country of armed Secessionists and
returned it to the Union; and in so doing he
showed energy and good tactical ability. These
achievements, which later in the war would have
seemed inconsiderable, now led to confidence and
promotion.</p>

<p>In his new and exalted position McClellan became
commander of a great number of men, but
not of a great army. The agglomeration of civilians,
who had run away from Manassas under the
impression that they had fought and lost a real
battle, was utterly disorganized and demoralized.
Some had already reached the sweet safety of the
villages of the North; others were lounging in the
streets of Washington and swelling the receipts of
its numerous barrooms. The majority, it is true,
were in camp across the Potomac, but in no condition
to render service. All, having been enlisted
for three months, now had only a trifling remnant
of so-called military life before them, in which it
<!-- Image No 331 --><a name='Png331'></a><a name='Page305'></a><span class="pagenum">305</span>
seemed to many hardly worth while to run risks.
The new call for volunteers for three years had
just gone forth, and though troops began to arrive
under it with surprising promptitude and many
three months' men re&euml;nlisted, yet a long time had
to elapse before the new levies were all on hand.
Thus betwixt departing and coming hosts McClellan's
duty was not to use an army, but to
create one.</p>

<p>The task looked immeasurable, but there was
a fortunate fitness for it upon both sides. The
men who in this awful crisis were answering the
summons of President Lincoln constituted a raw
material of a kind such as never poured into any
camp save possibly into that of Cromwell. For
the most part they were courageous, intelligent,
self-respecting citizens, who were under the noble
compulsion of conscience and patriotism in leaving
reputable and prosperous callings for a military
career. The moral, mental, and physical average
of such a body of men was a long way above that
of professional armies, and insured readiness in
acquiring their new calling. But admirable as
were the latent possibilities, and apt as each individual
might be, these multitudes arrived wholly
uninstructed; few had even so much as seen a real
soldier; none had any notion at all of what military
discipline was, or how to handle arms, or to
manoeuvre, or to take care of their health. Nor
could they easily get instruction in these things,
for officers knew no more than privates; indeed,
<!-- Image No 332 --><a name='Png332'></a><a name='Page306'></a><span class="pagenum">306</span>
for that matter, one of the great difficulties at first
encountered lay in the large proportion of utterly
unfit men who had succeeded in getting commissions,
and who had to be toilfully eliminated.</p>

<p>That which was to be done, McClellan was well
able to do. He had a passion for organization,
and fine capacity for work; he showed tact and
skill in dealing with subordinates; he had a thorough
knowledge and a high ideal of what an
army should be. He seemed the Genius of Order
as he educated and arranged the chaotic gathering
of human beings, who came before him to be
transmuted from farmers, merchants, clerks, shopkeepers,
and what not into soldiers of all arms and
into leaders of soldiers. To that host in chrysalis
he was what each skillful drill-master is to his
awkward squad. Under his influence privates
learned how to obey and officers how to command;
each individual merged the sense of individuality
in that of homogeneousness and cohesion, until
the original loose association of units became one
grand unit endowed with the solidarity and machine-like
quality of an efficient army. Patient
labor produced a result so excellent that General
Meade said long afterward: &quot;Had there been no
McClellan there could have been no Grant, for the
army made no essential improvement under any of
his successors.&quot;</p>

<p>That the formation of this great complex machine
was indispensable, and that it would take
much time, were facts which the disaster at Bull
<!-- Image No 333 --><a name='Png333'></a><a name='Page307'></a><span class="pagenum">307</span>
Run had compelled both the administration and
the people to appreciate moderately well. Accordingly
they resolutely set themselves to be patient.
The cry of &quot;On to Richmond!&quot; no longer sounded
through the land, and the restraint imposed by
the excited masses upon their own ardor was the
strongest evidence of their profound earnestness.
In a steady stream they poured men and material
into the camps in Virginia, and they heard
with satisfaction of the advance of the levies in
discipline and soldierly efficiency. For a while
the scene was pleasant and without danger. &quot;It
was,&quot; says Arnold, describing that of which he had
been an eye-witness, &quot;the era of brilliant reviews
and magnificent military displays, of parades, festive
parties, and junketings.&quot; Members of Congress
found excursions to the camps attractive for
themselves and their visitors. Glancing arms, new
uniforms, drill, and music constituted a fine show.
Thus the rest of the summer passed away, and
autumn came and was passing, too. Then here
and there signs of impatience began again to be
manifested. It was observed with discontent that
the glorious days of the Indian Summer, the
perfect season for military operations, were gliding
by as tranquilly as if there were not a great war
on hand, and still the citizen at home read each
morning in his newspaper the stereotyped bulletin,
&quot;All quiet on the Potomac;&quot; the phrase passed
into a byword and a sneer. By this time, too,
to a nation which had not European standards of
<!-- Image No 334 --><a name='Png334'></a><a name='Page308'></a><span class="pagenum">308</span>
excellence, the army seemed to have reached a
high state of efficiency, and to be abundantly able
to take the field. Why did not its commander
move? Amid all the drilling and band-playing
the troops had been doing hard work: a chain of
strong fortifications scientifically constructed had
been completed around the capital, and rendered it
easy of defense. It could be left in safety. Why,
then, was it not left? Why did the troops still
linger?</p>

<p>For a moment this monotony was interrupted by
the ill-conducted engagement at Ball's Bluff. On
October 21 nearly 2000 troops were sent across the
Potomac by the local commander, with the foolish
expectation of achieving something brilliant.<a name='FNanchor_146_148'></a><a href='#Footnote_146_148'><sup>[146]</sup></a>
 The
actual result was that they were corralled in an open
field; in their rear the precipitous bank dropped
sharply to the river, upon which floated only the
two or three little boats which had ferried them
across in small parties; in front and flank from
the shelter of thick woods an outnumbering force
of rebels poured a steady fire upon them. They
were in a cruel snare, and suffered terribly in
killed and drowned, wounded and captured. The
affair was, and the country at once saw that it was,
a gross blunder. The responsibility lay upon General
Stone and Colonel Baker. Stone, a military
man by education, deserved censure, but he was
<!-- Image No 335 --><a name='Png335'></a><a name='Page309'></a><span class="pagenum">309</span>
treated in a manner so cruel, so unjust, and so disproportionate
to his deserts, that his error has been
condoned in sympathy for his wrongs. The injustice
was chargeable chiefly to Stanton, in part to
the Committee on the Conduct of the War. Apparently
Mr. Lincoln desired to know as little as
possible about a wrong which he could not set
right without injury to the public interests. He
said to Stanton concerning the arrest: &quot;I suppose
you have good reasons for it, and having good reasons
I am glad I knew nothing of it until it was
done.&quot; To General Stone himself he said that,
if he should tell all he knew about it, he should
not tell much. Colonel Baker, senator from Oregon,
a personal friend of the President, a brilliant
orator, and a man beloved and admired by all who
knew him, was a favorable specimen of the great
body of new civilian officers. While brimming
over with gallantry and enthusiasm, he was entirely
ignorant of the military art. In the conduct
of this enterprise a considerable discretion
had been reposed in him, and he had, as was altogether
natural, failed in everything except courage.
But as he paid with his life on the battlefield the
penalty of his daring and his inexperience, he was
thought of only with tenderness and regret.</p>

<p>This skirmish illustrated the scant trust which
could yet be reposed in the skill and judgment of
subordinate officers. The men behaved with encouraging
spirit and constancy under severe trial.
But could a commander venture upon a campaign
<!-- Image No 336 --><a name='Png336'></a><a name='Page310'></a><span class="pagenum">310</span>
with brigadier-generals and colonels so unfit to
assume responsibility?</p>

<p>Nevertheless impatience hardly received a momentary
check from this lesson. With some inconsistency,
people placed unlimited confidence in
McClellan's capacity to beat the enemy, but no
confidence at all in his judgment as to the feasibility
of a forward movement. The grumbling
did not, however, indicate that faith in him was
shaken, for just now he was given promotion by
Mr. Lincoln, and it met with general approval.
For some time past it had been a cause of discomfort
that he did not get on altogether smoothly
with General Scott; the elder was irascible and
jealous, the younger certainly not submissive. At
last, on October 31, the old veteran regretfully
but quite wisely availed himself of his right to
be placed upon the retired list, and immediately,
November 1, General McClellan succeeded him in
the distinguished position of commander-in-chief
(under the President) of all the armies of the
United States. On the same day Mr. Lincoln
courteously hastened out to headquarters to make
in person congratulations which were unquestionably
as sincere as they were generous. Every one
felt that a magnificent opportunity was given to
a favorite general. But unfortunately among all
his admirers there was not one who believed in him
quite so fully as he believed in himself; he lost all
sense of perspective and proportion, and felt upon
a pinnacle from which he could look down even
<!-- Image No 337 --><a name='Png337'></a><a name='Page311'></a><span class="pagenum">311</span>
on a president.<a name='FNanchor_147_149'></a><a href='#Footnote_147_149'><sup>[147]</sup></a>
 Being in this masterful temper,
he haughtily disregarded the growing demand for
an advance. On the other hand the politicians,
always eager to minister to the gratification of the
people, began to be importunate; they harried the
President, and went out to camp to prick their
civilian spurs into the general himself. But McClellan
had a soldierly contempt for such intermeddling
in matters military, and was wholly
unimpressible. When Senator Wade said that an
unsuccessful battle was preferable to delay, for
that a defeat would easily be repaired by swarming
recruits, the general tartly replied that he preferred
a few recruits before a victory to a great
many after a defeat. But, however cleverly and
fairly the military man might counter upon the
politician, there was no doubt that discontent was
developing dangerously. The people had conscientiously
intended to do their part fully, and a
large proportion of them now sincerely believed
that they had done it. They knew that they had
been lavish of men, money, and supplies; and they
thought that they had been not less liberal of time;
wherefore they rebelled against the contrary opinion
of the general, whose ideal of a trustworthy army
had by no means been reached, and who, being of
a stubborn temperament, would not stir till it had
been.</p>

<p>It is difficult to satisfy one's self of the real
<!-- Image No 338 --><a name='Png338'></a><a name='Page312'></a><span class="pagenum">312</span>
fitness of the army to move at or about this time,&mdash;that
is to say, in or near the month of November,
1861,&mdash;for the evidence is mixed and conflicting.
The Committee on the Conduct of the War
asserted that &quot;the army of the Potomac was well
armed and equipped and had reached a high state
of discipline by the last of September or first of
October;&quot; but the committee was not composed
of experts. Less florid commendation is given by
the Comte de Paris, of date October 15. McClellan
himself said: &quot;It certainly was not till
late in November that the army was in any condition
to move, nor even then were they capable
of assaulting intrenched positions.&quot; At that time
winter was at hand, and advance was said to be
impracticable. That these statements were as favorable
as possible seems probable; for it is familiar
knowledge that the call for these troops did
not issue until July, that at the close of November
the recruits were still continuing &quot;to pour in, to
be assigned and equipped and instructed;&quot;<a name='FNanchor_148_150'></a><a href='#Footnote_148_150'><sup>[148]</sup></a>
 that
many came unarmed or with useless weapons; and
that these &quot;civilians, suddenly called to arms as
soldiers and officers, did not take kindly to the
subordination and restraints of the camp.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_149_151'></a><a href='#Footnote_149_151'><sup>[149]</sup></a>
 Now
McClellan's temperament did not lead him to run
risks in the effort to force achievements with
means of dubious adequacy. His purpose was to
create a machine perfect in every part, sure and
irresistible in operation, and then to set it in
<!-- Image No 339 --><a name='Png339'></a><a name='Page313'></a><span class="pagenum">313</span>
motion with a certainty of success. He wrote to
Lincoln: &quot;I have ever regarded our true policy as
being that of fully preparing ourselves, and then
seeking for the most decisive results.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_150_152'></a><a href='#Footnote_150_152'><sup>[150]</sup></a>
 Under
favoring circumstances this plan might have been
the best. But circumstances were not favoring.
Neither he nor the government itself, nor indeed
both together, could afford long or far to disregard
popular feeling. Before the close of November
that popular feeling was such that the people
would have endured without flinching the discouragement
of a defeat, but would not endure the
severe tax of inaction, and from this time forth
their impatience gathered volume until it became
a controlling element in the situation. Themselves
intending to be reasonable, they grew more
and more convinced that McClellan was unreasonable.
General and people confronted each other:
the North would fight, at the risk of defeat; McClellan
would not fight, because he was not sure
to win. Any one who comprehended the conditions,
the institutions of the country, the character
of the nation, especially its temper concerning the
present conflict, also the necessities beneath which
that conflict must be waged, if it was to be waged
at all, would have seen that the people must be
deferred to. The question was not whether they
were right or wrong. Assuming them to be
wrong, it would still be a mistake to withstand
them beyond a certain point. If yielding to them
<!-- Image No 340 --><a name='Png340'></a><a name='Page314'></a><span class="pagenum">314</span>
should result in disastrous consequences, they must
be called upon to rally, and could be trusted to do
so, instructed but undismayed by their experience.
All this McClellan utterly failed to appreciate,
thereby leading Mr. Swinton very justly to remark
that he was lacking in &quot;the statesmanlike qualities
that enter into the composition of a great general.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_151_153'></a><a href='#Footnote_151_153'><sup>[151]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>On the other hand, no man ever lived more
capable than Mr. Lincoln of precisely appreciating
the present facts, or more sure to avoid those
peculiar blunders which entrapped the military
commander. He was very loyal in living up to his
pledge to give the general full support, and by his
conduct during many months to come he proved
his readiness to abide to the last possible point.
He knew, however, with unerring accuracy just
where that last point lay, and he saw with disquietude
that it was being approached too rapidly.
He was getting sufficient knowledge of McClellan's
character to see that the day was not distant when
he must interfere. Meantime he kept his sensitive
finger upon the popular pulse, as an expert
physician watches a patient in a fever. With the
growth of the impatience his anxiety grew, for
the people's war would not be successfully fought
by a dissatisfied people. Repeatedly he tested the
<!-- Image No 341 --><a name='Png341'></a><a name='Page315'></a><span class="pagenum">315</span>
situation in the hope that a movement could be
forced without undue imprudence; but he was
always met by objections from McClellan. In
weighing the Northern and the Southern armies
against each other, the general perhaps undervalued
his own resources and certainly overvalued
those of his opponent. He believed that the Confederate
&quot;discipline and drill were far better than
our own;&quot; wherein he was probably in error, for
General Lee admitted that, while the Southerners
would always fight well, they were refractory under
discipline. Moreover, they were at this time very
ill provided with equipment and transportation.
Also McClellan said that the Southern army had
thrown up intrenchments at Manassas and Centreville,
and therefore the &quot;problem was to attack
victorious and finely drilled troops in intrenchment.&quot;
But the most discouraging and inexplicable
assertion, which he emphatically reiterated,
concerned the relative numerical strength. He
not only declared that he himself could not put
into the field the numbers shown by the official
returns to be with him, but also he exaggerated
the Southern numbers till he became extravagant
to the point of absurdity. So it had been from
the outset, and so it continued to be to the time
when he was at last relieved of his command.
Thus, on August 15, he conceived himself to be
&quot;in a terrible place; the enemy have three or
four times my force.&quot; September 9 he imagined
Johnston to have 130,000 men, against his own
<!-- Image No 342 --><a name='Png342'></a><a name='Page316'></a><span class="pagenum">316</span>
85,000; and he argued that Johnston could move
upon Baltimore a column 100,000 strong, which
he could meet with only 60,000 or 70,000. Later
in October he marked the Confederates up to
150,000. He estimated his own requirement at
a &quot;total effective force&quot; of 208,000 men, which
implied &quot;an aggregate, present and absent, of
about 240,000 men.&quot; Of these he designed
150,000 as a &quot;column of active operations;&quot; the
rest were for garrisons and guards. He said that
in fact he had a gross aggregate of 168,318, and
the &quot;force present for duty was 147,695.&quot; Since
the garrisons and the guards were a fixed number,
the reduction fell wholly upon the movable column,
and reduced &quot;the number disposable for an
advance to 76,285.&quot; Thus he made himself out
to be fatally overmatched. But he was excessively
in error. In the autumn Johnston's effective
force was only 41,000 men, and on December
1, 1861, it was 47,000.<a name='FNanchor_152_154'></a><a href='#Footnote_152_154'><sup>[152]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>Such comparisons, advanced with positiveness
by the highest authority, puzzled Mr. Lincoln.
They seemed very strange, yet he could not disprove
them, and was therefore obliged to face the
perplexing choice which was mercilessly set before
him: &quot;either to go into winter quarters, or to
assume the offensive with forces greatly inferior in
<!-- Image No 343 --><a name='Png343'></a><a name='Page317'></a><span class="pagenum">317</span>
number&quot; to what was &quot;desirable and necessary.&quot;
&quot;If political considerations render the first course
unadvisable, the second alone remains.&quot; The general's
most cheering admission was that, by stripping
all other armies down to the lowest numbers
absolutely necessary for a strict defensive, and by
concentrating all the forces of the nation and all
the attention of the government upon &quot;the vital
point&quot; in Virginia, it might yet be possible for
this &quot;main army, whose destiny it [was] to decide
the controversy,... to move with a reasonable
prospect of success before the winter is fairly upon
us.&quot; A direct assertion of impossibility, provocative
of denial or discussion, would have been less
disheartening.</p>

<p>In passing, it may be remarked that McClellan's
prevision that the ultimate arbitrament of
the struggle must occur in Virginia was correct.
But in another point he was wrong, and unfortunately
this was of more immediate consequence,
because it corroborated him in his purpose to delay
till he could make success a certainty. He hoped
that when he moved, he should be able to win one
or two overwhelming victories, to capture Richmond,
and to crush the rebellion in a few weeks.
It was a brilliant and captivating programme,<a name='FNanchor_153_155'></a><a href='#Footnote_153_155'><sup>[153]</sup></a>

<!-- Image No 344 --><a name='Png344'></a><a name='Page318'></a><span class="pagenum">318</span>
but impracticable and undesirable. Even had the
Southerners been quelled by so great a disaster,&mdash;which
was not likely,&mdash;they would not have
been thoroughly conquered, nor would slavery
have been disposed of, and both these events were
indispensable to a definitive peace between the two
sections. Whether the President shared this notion
of his general is not evident. Apparently he
was not putting his mind upon theories reaching
into the future so much as he was devoting his
whole thought to dealing with the urgent problems
of the present. If this was the case, he was
pursuing the wise and sound course. In the situation,
it was more desirable to fight a great battle
at the earliest possible moment than to await a
great victory many months hence.</p>

<p>It is commonplace wisdom that it is foolish for
a civilian to undertake the direction of a war.
Yet our Constitution ordains that &quot;the President
shall be commander-in-chief of the army and navy
of the United States, and of the militia of the
several States, when called into the actual service
of the United States.&quot; It is not supposable that
the delegates who suggested this function, or the
people who ordained it, anticipated that presidents
generally would be men skilled in military science.
Therefore Mr. Lincoln could not escape the obligation
on the ground of unfitness for the duty
which was imperatively placed upon him. It might
be true that to set him in charge of military operations
was like ordering a merchant to paint a picture
<!-- Image No 345 --><a name='Png345'></a><a name='Page319'></a><span class="pagenum">319</span>
or a jockey to sail a ship, but it was also true
that he was so set in charge. He could not shirk
it, nor did he try to shirk it. In consequence
hostile critics have dealt mercilessly with his actions,
and the history of this winter and spring of
1861-62 is a painful and confusing story of bitter
controversy and crimination. Further it is to be
remembered that, apart from the obligation imposed
on the President by the Constitution, it was
true that if civilians could not make rapid progress
in the military art, the war might as well be
abandoned. They were already supposed to be
doing so; General Banks, a politician, and General
Butler, a lawyer, were already conducting important
movements. Still it remains undeniable that
finally it was only the professional soldiers who,
undergoing successfully the severe test of time,
composed the illustrious front rank of strategists
when the close of the war left every man in his
established place. In discussing this perplexing
period, extremists upon one side attribute the miscarriages
and failure of McClellan's campaign to
ceaseless, thwarting interference by the President,
the secretary of war, and other civil officials. Extremists
upon the other side allege the marvel that
a sudden development of unerring judgment upon
every question involving the practical application
of military science took place on Mr. Lincoln's
part.<a name='FNanchor_154_156'></a><a href='#Footnote_154_156'><sup>[154]</sup></a>
Perhaps the truth lies between the disputants,
<!-- Image No 346 --><a name='Png346'></a><a name='Page320'></a><span class="pagenum">320</span>
but it is not likely ever to be definitely
agreed upon so long as the controversy excites
interest; for the discussion bristles with <i>ifs</i>, and
where this is the case no advocate can be irremediably
vanquished.</p>

<p>It seems right, at this place, to note one fact
concerning Mr. Lincoln which ought not to be
overlooked and which cannot be denied. This is
his entire <i>political unselfishness</i>, the rarest moral
quality among men in public life. In those days
of trouble and distrust slanders were rife in a
degree which can hardly be appreciated by men
whose experience has been only with quieter times.
Sometimes purposes and sometimes methods were
assailed; and those prominent in civil life, and a
few also in military life, were believed to be artfully
and darkly seeking to interlace their personal
political fortunes in the web of public affairs, naturally
subordinating the latter fabric. Alliances,
enmities, intrigues, schemes, and every form of
putting the interest of self before that of the nation,
were insinuated with a bitter malevolence
unknown except amid such abnormal conditions.
The few who escaped charges of this kind were
believed to cherish their own peculiar fanaticisms,
desires, and purposes concerning the object and
results of the struggle, which they were resolved
to satisfy at almost any cost and by almost any
means. While posterity is endeavoring very
wisely to discredit and to forget a great part of
these painful criminations, it is cheering to find
<!-- Image No 347 --><a name='Png347'></a><a name='Page321'></a><span class="pagenum">321</span>
that no effort has to be made to forget anything
about the President. In his case injurious gossip
has long since died away and been buried. Whatever
may be said of him in other respects, at least
the purity and the singleness of his patriotism
shine brilliant and luminous through all this cloud-dust
of derogation. By his position he had more
at stake, both in his lifetime and before the tribunal
of the future, than any other person in the
country. But there was only one idea in his
mind, and that was,&mdash;not that <i>he should save the
country</i>, but <i>that the country should be saved</i>.
Not the faintest shadow of self ever fell for an
instant across this simple purpose. He was intent
to play his part out faithfully, with all the ability
he could bring to it; but any one else, who could,
might win and wear the title of savior. He chiefly
cared that the saving should be done. Never
once did he manipulate any covert magnet to draw
toward himself the credit or the glory of a measure
or a move. To his own future he seemed to give
no thought. It would be unjust to allow the dread
of appearing to utter eulogy rather than historic
truth to betray a biographer into overlooking this
genuine magnanimity.</p>

<hr class='short'/>

<p>It was in December, 1861, that Congress created
the famous Committee on the Conduct of the War,
to some of whose doings it has already been necessary
to allude. The gentlemen who were placed
upon it were selected partly of course for political
<!-- Image No 348 --><a name='Png348'></a><a name='Page322'></a><span class="pagenum">322</span>
reasons, and were all men who had made themselves
conspicuous for their enthusiasm and vehemence;
not one of them had any military knowledge.
The committee magnified its office almost
beyond limit,&mdash;investigated everything; haled
whom it chose to testify before it; made reports,
expressed opinions, insisted upon policies and
measures in matters military; and all with a dictatorial
assumption and self-confidence which could
not be devoid of effect, although every one knew
that each individual member was absolutely without
fitness for this business. So the committee
made itself a great power, and therefore also a
great complication, in the war machinery; and
though it was sometimes useful, yet, upon a final
balancing of its long account, it failed to justify
its existence, as, indeed, was to have been expected
from the outset.<a name='FNanchor_155_157'></a><a href='#Footnote_155_157'><sup>[155]</sup></a>
 In the present discussions concerning
an advance of the army, its members strenuously
insisted upon immediate action, and their
official influence brought much strength to that
side.</p>

<p>The first act indicating an intention on the
part of the President to interfere occurred almost
simultaneously with the beginning of the general's
illness. About December 21, 1861, he handed to
McClellan a brief memorandum: &quot;If it were determined
to make a forward movement of the army
<!-- Image No 349 --><a name='Png349'></a><a name='Page323'></a><span class="pagenum">323</span>
of the Potomac, without awaiting further increase
of numbers or better drill and discipline, how long
would it require to actually get in motion? After
leaving all that would be necessary, how many
troops could join the movement from southwest
of the river? How many from northeast of it?&quot;
Then he proceeded briefly to hint rather than distinctly
to suggest that plan of a direct advance by
way of Centreville and Manassas, which later on
he persistently advocated. Ten days elapsed before
McClellan returned answers, which then came
in a shape too curt to be respectful. Almost immediately
afterward the general fell ill, an occurrence
which seemed to his detractors a most aggravating
and unjustifiable intervention of Nature
herself in behalf of his policy of delay.</p>

<p>On January 10 a dispatch from General Halleck
represented in his department also a condition of
check and helplessness. Lincoln noted upon it:
&quot;Exceedingly discouraging. As everywhere else,
nothing can be done.&quot; Yet something must be
done, for the game was not to be abandoned.
Under this pressure, on this same day, he visited
McClellan, but could not see him; nor could he
get any definite idea how long might be the duration
of the typhoid fever, the lingering and uncertain
disease which had laid the general low.
Accordingly he summoned General McDowell and
General Franklin to discuss with him that evening
the military situation. The secretaries of state
and of the treasury, and the assistant secretary of
<!-- Image No 350 --><a name='Png350'></a><a name='Page324'></a><span class="pagenum">324</span>
war, also came. The President, says McDowell,
&quot;was greatly disturbed at the state of affairs,&quot;
&quot;was in great distress,&quot; and said that, &quot;if something
was not soon done, the bottom would be out
of the whole affair; and if General McClellan did
not want to use the army, he would like to '<i>borrow
it</i>,' provided he could see how it could be made to
do something.&quot; The two generals were directed
to inform themselves concerning the &quot;actual condition
of the army,&quot; and to come again the next
day. Conferences followed on January 11 and
12, Postmaster-General Blair and General Meigs
being added to the council. The postmaster-general
condemned a direct advance as &quot;strategically
defective,&quot; while Chase descanted on the &quot;moral
power&quot; of a victory. The picture of the two civilians
injecting their military suggestions is not
reassuring. Meigs is somewhat vaguely reported
to have favored a &quot;battle in front.&quot;</p>

<p>McDowell and Franklin had not felt justified
in communicating these occurrences to McClellan,
because the President had marked his order to
them &quot;private and confidential.&quot; But the commander
heard rumors of what was going forward,<a name='FNanchor_156_158'></a><a href='#Footnote_156_158'><sup>[156]</sup></a>

and on January 12 he came from his sick-room
to see the President; he was &quot;looking quite well,&quot;
and apparently was &quot;able to assume the charge of
the army.&quot; The apparition put a different complexion
upon the pending discussions. On the
13th the same gentlemen met, but now with the
<!-- Image No 351 --><a name='Png351'></a><a name='Page325'></a><span class="pagenum">325</span>
addition of General McClellan. The situation
was embarrassing. McClellan took scant pains to
conceal his resentment. McDowell, at the request
of the President, explained what he thought could
be done, closing &quot;by saying something apologetic;&quot;
to which McClellan replied, &quot;somewhat
coldly if not curtly: 'You are entitled to have any
opinion you please.'&quot; Secretary Chase, a leader
among the anti-McClellanites, bluntly asked the
general to explain his military plans in detail;
but McClellan declined to be interrogated except
by the President, or by the secretary of war,
who was not present. Finally, according to McClellan's
account, which differs a little but not
essentially from that of McDowell, Mr. Lincoln
suggested<a name='FNanchor_157_159'></a><a href='#Footnote_157_159'><sup>[157]</sup></a>
 that he should tell what his plans were.
McClellan replied, in substance, that this would
be imprudent and seemed unnecessary, and that he
would only give information if the President would
order him in writing to do so, and would assume
the responsibility for the results.<a name='FNanchor_158_160'></a><a href='#Footnote_158_160'><sup>[158]</sup></a>
 McDowell adds
(but McClellan does not), that the President then
asked McClellan &quot;if he had counted upon any
particular time; he did not ask what that time
was, but had he in his own mind any particular
time fixed, when a movement could be commenced.
He replied, he had. 'Then,' rejoined the President,
<!-- Image No 352 --><a name='Png352'></a><a name='Page326'></a><span class="pagenum">326</span>
'I will adjourn this meeting.'&quot; This unfortunate
episode aggravated the discord, and removed
confidence and co&ouml;peration farther away than ever
before.</p>

<p>The absence of the secretary of war from these
meetings was due to the fact that a change in the
War Department was in process contemporaneously
with them. The President had been allowed
to understand that Mr. Cameron did not find his
duties agreeable, and might prefer a diplomatic
post. Accordingly, with no show of reluctance,
Mr. Lincoln, on January 11, 1862, offered to Mr.
Cameron the post of minister to Russia. It was
promptly accepted, and on January 13 Edwin M.
Stanton was nominated and confirmed to fill the
vacancy.<a name='FNanchor_159_161'></a><a href='#Footnote_159_161'><sup>[159]</sup></a>
 The selection was a striking instance
of the utter absence of vindictiveness which so
distinguished Mr. Lincoln, who, in fact, was simply
insensible to personal feeling as an influence.
In choosing incumbents for public trusts, he knew
no foe, perhaps no friend; but as dispassionately
as if he were manoeuvring pieces on a chessboard,
he considered only which available piece would
serve best in the square which he had to fill. In
1859 he and Stanton had met as associate counsel
in perhaps the most important lawsuit in which
Mr. Lincoln had ever been concerned, and Stanton
had treated Lincoln with his habitual insolence.<a name='FNanchor_160_162'></a><a href='#Footnote_160_162'><sup>[160]</sup></a>

<!-- Image No 353 --><a name='Png353'></a>
<!-- Image No 354 --><a name='Png354'></a>
<!-- Image No 355 --><a name='Png355'></a><a name='Page327'></a><span class="pagenum">327</span>
Later, in the trying months which closed the year
1861, Stanton had abused the administration with
violence, and had carried his revilings of the President
even to the point of coarse personal insults.<a name='FNanchor_161_163'></a><a href='#Footnote_161_163'><sup>[161]</sup></a>

No man, not being a rebel, had less right to expect
an invitation to become an adviser of the President;
and most men, who had felt or expressed
the opinions held by Mr. Stanton, would have had
scruples or delicacy about coming into the close
relationship of confidential adviser with the object
of their contempt; but neither scruples nor delicacy
delayed him; his acceptance was prompt.<a name='FNanchor_162_164'></a><a href='#Footnote_162_164'><sup>[162]</sup></a>
</p>

Edwin M. Stanton.
</p>

<p>So Mr. Lincoln had chosen his secretary solely
upon the belief of the peculiar fitness of the individual
for the special duties of the war office.
Upon the whole the choice was wisely made, and
was evidence of Mr. Lincoln's insight into the
aptitudes and the uses of men. Stanton's abilities
commanded some respect, though his character
never excited either respect or liking; just now,
however, all his good qualities and many of his
faults seemed precisely adapted to the present requirements
of his department. He had been a
Democrat, but was now zealous to extremity in
patriotism; in his dealings with men he was capable
of much duplicity, yet in matters of business he
was rigidly honest, and it was his pleasure to protect
the treasury against the contractors; he loved
<!-- Image No 356 --><a name='Png356'></a><a name='Page328'></a><span class="pagenum">328</span>
work, and never wearied amid the driest and most
exacting toil; he was prompt and decisive rather
than judicial or correct in his judgments concerning
men and things; he was arbitrary, harsh, bad-tempered,
and impulsive; he often committed acts
of injustice or cruelty, for which he rarely made
amends, and still more rarely seemed disturbed by
remorse or regret. These traits bore hard upon
individuals; but ready and unscrupulous severity
was supposed to have its usefulness in a civil war.
Many a time he taxed the forbearance of the President
to a degree that would have seemed to transcend
the uttermost limit of human patience, if Mr.
Lincoln had not taken these occasions to show to
the world how forbearing and patient it is possible
for man to be. But those who knew the relations
of the two men are agreed that Stanton, however
browbeating he was to others, recognized a master
in the President, and, though often grumbling
and insolent, always submitted if a crisis came.
Undoubtedly Mr. Lincoln was the only ruler
known to history who could have co&ouml;perated for
years with such a minister. He succeeded in doing
so because he believed it to be for the good of
the cause, to which he could easily subordinate all
personal considerations; and posterity, agreeing
with him, concedes to Stanton credit for efficiency
in the conduct of his department.</p>

<p>It is worth while here to pause long enough to
read part of a letter which, on this same crowded
thirteenth day of January, 1862, the President sent
<!-- Image No 357 --><a name='Png357'></a><a name='Page329'></a><span class="pagenum">329</span>
to General Halleck, in the West: &quot;For my own
views: I have not offered, and do not now offer,
them as orders; and while I am glad to have them
respectfully considered, I would blame you to follow
them contrary to your own clear judgment,
unless I should put them in the form of orders....
With this preliminary, I state my general
idea of this war to be that we have the greater
numbers and the enemy has the greater facility
of concentrating forces upon points of collision;
that we must fail unless we can find some way of
making our advantage an overmatch for his; and
that this can only be done by menacing him with
superior forces at different points at the same
time, so that we can safely attack one or both
if he makes no change; and if he weakens one
to strengthen the other, forbear to attack the
strengthened one, but seize and hold the weakened
one, gaining so much.&quot;</p>

<p>In a personal point of view this short letter is
pregnant with interest and suggestion. The writer's
sad face, eloquent of the charge and burden
of one of the most awful destinies of human-kind,
rises before us as we read the expression of his
modest self-distrust amid the strange duties of
military affairs. But closely following this comes
the intimation that in due time &quot;<i>orders</i>&quot; will
come. Such was the quiet, unflinching way in
which Lincoln always faced every test, apparently
with a tranquil and assured faith that, whatever
might seem his lack of fitting preparation, his best
<!-- Image No 358 --><a name='Png358'></a><a name='Page330'></a><span class="pagenum">330</span>
would be adequate to the occasion. The habit has
led many to fancy that he believed himself divinely
chosen, and therefore sure of infallible guidance;
but it is observable far back, almost from
the beginning of his life; it was a trait of mind
and character, nothing else. The letter closes
with a broad general theory concerning the war,
wrought out by that careful process of thinking
whereby he was wont to make his way to the big,
simple, and fundamental truth. The whole is worth
holding in memory through the narrative of the
coming weeks.</p>

<p>The conference of January 13 developed a serious
difference of opinion as to the plan of campaign,
whenever a campaign should be entered
upon. The President's notion, already shadowed
forth in his memorandum of December, was to
move directly upon the rebel army at Centreville
and Manassas and to press it back upon Richmond,
with the purpose of capturing that city.
But McClellan presented as his project a movement
by Urbana and West Point, using the York
River as a base of supplies. General McDowell
and Secretary Chase favored the President's plan;
General Franklin and Postmaster Blair thought
better of McClellan's. The President had a
strong fancy for his own scheme, because by it the
Union army was kept between the enemy and
Washington; and therefore the supreme point of
importance, the safety of the national capital, was
insured. The discussion, which was thus opened
<!-- Image No 359 --><a name='Png359'></a><a name='Page331'></a><span class="pagenum">331</span>
and which remained long unsettled, had, among
other ill effects, that of sustaining the vexatious
delay. While the anti-McClellan faction&mdash;for
the matter was becoming one of factions<a name='FNanchor_163_165'></a><a href='#Footnote_163_165'><sup>[163]</sup></a>
&mdash;grew
louder in denunciation of his inaction, and fastened
upon him the contemptuous nickname of &quot;the
Virginia creeper,&quot; the friends of the general retorted
that the President, meddling in what he
did not understand, would not let the military commander
manage the war.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Mr. Lincoln, dispassionate and
fair-minded as usual, allowed neither their personal
difference of opinion nor this abusive outcry
to inveigle into his mind any prejudice against
McClellan. The Southerner who, in February,
1861, predicted that Lincoln &quot;would do his own
thinking,&quot; read character well. Lincoln was now
doing precisely this thing, in his silent, thorough,
independent way, neither provoked by McClellan's
cavalier assumption of superior knowledge, nor
<!-- Image No 360 --><a name='Png360'></a><a name='Page332'></a><span class="pagenum">332</span>
alarmed by the danger of offending the politicians.
In fact, he decided to go counter to both the disputants;
for he resolved, on the one hand, to compel
McClellan to act; on the other, to maintain
him in his command. He did not, however, abandon
his own plan of campaign. On January 27,
as commander-in-chief of the army, he issued his
&quot;General War Order No. 1.&quot; In this he directed
&quot;that the 22d day of February, 1862, be
the day for a general movement of the land and
naval forces of the United States against the insurgent
forces;&quot; and said that heads of departments
and military and naval commanders would
&quot;be held to their strict and full responsibilities
for prompt execution of this order.&quot; By this he
practically repudiated McClellan's scheme, because
transportation and other preparations for pursuing
the route by Urbana could not be made ready by
the date named.</p>

<p>Critics of the President have pointed to this
document as a fine instance of the follies to be expected
from a civil ruler who conducts a war. To
order an advance all along a line from the Mississippi
to the Atlantic, upon a day certain, without
regard to differing local conditions and exigencies,
and to notify the enemy of the purpose nearly a
month beforehand, were acts preposterous according
to military science. But the criticism was not
so fair as it was obvious. The order really bore
in part the character of a manifesto; to the people
of the North, whose confidence must be kept and
<!-- Image No 361 --><a name='Png361'></a><a name='Page333'></a><span class="pagenum">333</span>
their spirit sustained, it said that the administration
meant action at once; to commanding officers
it was a fillip, warning them to bestir themselves,
obstacles to the contrary notwithstanding. It was
a reveille. Further, in a general way it undoubtedly
laid out a sound plan of campaign, substantially
in accordance with that which McClellan
also was evolving, viz.: to press the enemy all
along the western and middle line, and thus to
prevent his making too formidable a concentration
in Virginia. In the end, however, practicable or
impracticable, wise or foolish, the order was never
fulfilled. The armies in Virginia did nothing till
many weeks after the anniversary of Washington's
birthday; whereas, in the West, Admiral Foote
and General Grant did not conceive that they were
enforced to rest in idleness until that historic date.
Before it arrived they had performed the brilliant
exploits of capturing Fort Henry and Fort Donelson.</p>

<p>On January 31 the President issued &quot;Special
War Order No. 1,&quot; directing the army of the Potomac
to seize and occupy &quot;a point upon the railroad
southwestward of what is known as Manassas Junction;... the
expedition to move before or on the
22d day of February next.&quot; This was the distinct,
as the general order had been the indirect, adoption
of his own plan of campaign, and the overruling
of that of the general. McClellan at once
remonstrated, and the two rival plans thus came
face to face for immediate and definitive settlement.
<!-- Image No 362 --><a name='Png362'></a><a name='Page334'></a><span class="pagenum">334</span>
It must be assumed that the President's
order had been really designed only to force exactly
this issue; for on February 3, so soon as he
received the remonstrance, he invited argument
from the general by writing to him a letter which
foreshadowed an open-minded reception for views
opposed to his own:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;If you will give satisfactory answers to the
following questions, I shall gladly yield my plan
to yours:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;1st. Does not your plan involve a greatly
larger expenditure of <i>time</i> and <i>money</i> than mine?</p>

<p>&quot;2d. Wherein is a victory <i>more certain</i> by your
plan than mine?</p>

<p>&quot;3d. Wherein is a victory <i>more valuable</i> by
your plan than mine?</p>

<p>&quot;4th. In fact, would it not be <i>less</i> valuable in
this: that it would break no great line of the
enemy's communications, while mine would?</p>

<p>&quot;5th. In case of disaster would not a retreat be
more difficult by your plan than mine?&quot;</p>

<p>To these queries McClellan replied by a long
and elaborate exposition of his views. He said
that, if the President's plan should be pursued
successfully, the &quot;results would be confined to the
possession of the field of battle, the evacuation of
the line of the upper Potomac by the enemy, and
the moral effect of the victory.&quot; On the other
hand, a movement in force by the route which he
advocated &quot;obliges the enemy to abandon his intrenched
position at Manassas, in order to hasten
<!-- Image No 363 --><a name='Png363'></a><a name='Page335'></a><span class="pagenum">335</span>
to cover Richmond and Norfolk.&quot; That is to say,
he expected to achieve by a manoeuvre what the
President designed to effect by a battle, to be
fought by inexperienced troops against an intrenched
enemy. He continued: &quot;This movement,
if successful, gives us the capital, the communications,
the supplies, of the rebels; Norfolk
would fall; all the waters of the Chesapeake
would be ours; all Virginia would be in our power,
and the enemy forced to abandon Tennessee and
North Carolina. The alternative presented to the
enemy would be, to beat us in a position selected
by ourselves, disperse, or pass beneath the Caudine
forks.&quot; In case of defeat the Union army would
have a &quot;perfectly secure retreat down the Peninsula
upon Fort Monroe.&quot; &quot;This letter,&quot; he afterward
wrote, &quot;must have produced some effect upon
the mind of the President!&quot; The slur was unjust.
The President now and always considered
the views of the general with a liberality of mind
rarely to be met with in any man, and certainly
never in McClellan himself. In this instance the
letter did in fact produce so much &quot;effect upon
the mind of the President&quot; that he prepared to
yield views which he held very strongly to views
which he was charged with not being able to
understand, and which he certainly could not bring
himself actually to believe in.</p>

<p>Yet before quite taking this step he demanded
that a council of the generals of division should be
summoned to express their opinions. This was
<!-- Image No 364 --><a name='Png364'></a><a name='Page336'></a><span class="pagenum">336</span>
done, with the result that McDowell, Sumner,
Heintzelman, and Barnard voted against McClellan's
plan; Keyes voted for it, with the proviso
&quot;that no change should be made until the rebels
were driven from their batteries on the Potomac.&quot;
Fitz-John Porter, Franklin, W.F. Smith, McCall,
Blenker, Andrew Porter, and Naglee (of Hooker's
division) voted for it. Stanton afterward said of
this: &quot;We saw ten generals afraid to fight.&quot; The
insult, delivered in the snug personal safety which
was suspected to be very dear to Stanton, was
ridiculous as aimed at men who soon handled some
of the most desperate battles of the war; but it is
interesting as an expression of the unreasoning
bitterness of the controversy then waging over the
situation in Virginia, a controversy causing animosities
vastly more fierce than any between Union
soldiers and Confederates, animosities which have
unfortunately lasted longer, and which can never
be brought to the like final and conclusive arbitrament.
The purely military question quickly became
snarled up with politics and was reduced to
very inferior proportions in the noxious competition.
&quot;Politics entered and strategy retired,&quot;
says General Webb, too truly. McClellan himself
conceived that the politicians were leagued to destroy
him, and would rather see him discredited
than the rebels whipped. In later days the strong
partisan loves and hatreds of our historical writers
have perpetuated and increased all this bad blood,
confusion, and obscurity.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 365 --><a name='Png365'></a><a name='Page337'></a><span class="pagenum">337</span>
The action of the council of generals was conclusive.
The President accepted McClellan's plan.
Therein he did right; for undeniably it was his
duty to allow his own inexperience to be controlled
by the deliberate opinion of the best military
experts in the country; and this fact is
wholly independent of any opinion concerning the
intrinsic or the comparative merits of the plans
themselves. Indeed, Mr. Lincoln had never expressed
positive disapproval of McClellan's plan
<i>per se</i>, but only had been alarmed at what seemed
to him its indirect result in exposing the capital.
To cover this point, he now made an imperative
preliminary condition that this safety should be
placed beyond a question. He was emphatic and
distinct in reiterating this proviso as fundamental.
The preponderance of professional testimony, from
that day to this, has been to the effect that McClellan's
strategy was sound and able, and that
Mr. Lincoln's anxiety for the capital was groundless.
But in spite of all argument, and though
military men may shed ink as if it were mere
blood, in spite even of the contempt and almost
ridicule which the President incurred at the pen
of McClellan,<a name='FNanchor_164_166'></a><a href='#Footnote_164_166'><sup>[164]</sup></a>
 the civilian will retain a lurking
sympathy with the President's preference. It is
<!-- Image No 366 --><a name='Png366'></a><a name='Page338'></a><span class="pagenum">338</span>
impossible not to reflect that precisely in proportion
as the safety of the capital, for many weighty
reasons, immeasurably outweighed any other possible
consideration in the minds of the Northerners,
so the desire to capture it would be equally overmastering
in the estimation of the Southerners.
Why might not the rebels permit McClellan to
march into Richmond, provided that at the same
time they were marching into Washington? Why
might they not, in the language afterward used by
General Lee, &quot;swap Queens?&quot; They would have
a thousand fold the better of the exchange. The
Northern Queen was an incalculably more valuable
piece on the board than was her Southern rival.
With the Northern government in flight, Maryland
would go to the Confederacy, and European
recognition would be sure and immediate; and
these two facts might, almost surely would, be
conclusive against the Northern cause. Moreover,
memory will obstinately bring up the fact that
long afterward, when General Grant was pursuing
a route to Richmond strategically not dissimilar
to that proposed by McClellan, and when all
the circumstances made the danger of a successful
attack upon Washington much less than it was
in the spring of 1862, the rebels actually all but
captured the city; and it was saved not alone by
a rapidity of movement which would have been
impossible in the early stages of the war, but also
by what must be called the aid of good luck. It
is difficult to see why General Jackson in 1862
<!-- Image No 367 --><a name='Png367'></a><a name='Page339'></a><span class="pagenum">339</span>
might not have played in fatal earnest a game
which in 1864 General Early played merely for
the chances. Pondering upon these things, it is
probable that no array of military scientists will
ever persuade the non-military world that Mr.
Lincoln was so timid, or so dull-witted, or so
unreasonable, as General McClellan declared him
to be.</p>

<p>Another consideration is suggested by some
remarks of Mr. Swinton. It is tolerably obvious
that, whether McClellan's plan was or was not the
better, the President's plan was entirely possible;
all that could be said against it was that it promised
somewhat poorer results at somewhat higher
cost. This being the case, and in view of the fact
that the President's disquietude concerning Washington
was so profound and his distrust of McClellan's
plan so ineradicable, it would have been
much better to have had the yielding come from
the general than from the President. A man of
less stubborn temper and of broader intellect than
belonged to McClellan would have appreciated
this. In fact, it was in a certain sense even poor
generalship to enter upon a campaign of such
magnitude, when a thorough and hearty co&ouml;peration
was really not to be expected. For after all
might be ostensibly settled and agreed upon, and
however honest might be Mr. Lincoln's intentions
to support the commanding general, one thing still
remained certain: that the safety of the capital
was Mr. Lincoln's weightiest responsibility, that it
<!-- Image No 368 --><a name='Png368'></a><a name='Page340'></a><span class="pagenum">340</span>
was a matter concerning which he was sensitively
anxious, and that he was perfectly sure in any moment
of alarm concerning that safety to insure
it by any means in his power and at any sacrifice
whatsoever. In a word, that which soon did happen
was precisely that which ought to have been
foreseen as likely to happen. For it was entirely
obvious that Mr. Lincoln did not abandon his own
scheme because his own reason was convinced of
the excellence of McClellan's; in fact, he never
was and never pretended to be thus convinced.
To his mind, McClellan's reasoning never overcame
his own reasoning; he only gave way before
professional authority; and, while he sincerely
meant to give McClellan the most efficient aid and
backing in his power, the anxiety about Washington
rested immovable in his thought. If the two
interests should ever, in his opinion, come into
competition, no one could doubt which would be
sacrificed. To push forward the Peninsula campaign
under these conditions was a terrible mistake
of judgment on McClellan's part. Far better
would it have been to have taken the Manassas
route; for even if its inherent demerits were
really so great as McClellan had depicted, they
would have been more than offset by preserving
the undiminished co&ouml;peration of the administration.
The personal elements in the problem ought
to have been conclusive.</p>

<p>An indication of the error of forcing the President
into a course not commended by his judgment,
<!-- Image No 369 --><a name='Png369'></a><a name='Page341'></a><span class="pagenum">341</span>
in a matter where his responsibility was so
grave, was seen immediately. On March 8 he
issued General War Order No. 3: That no change
of base should be made &quot;without leaving in and
about Washington such a force as, in the opinion
of the general-in-chief and the commanders of
army corps, shall leave said city entirely secure;&quot;
that not more than two corps (about 50,000 men)
should be moved en route for a new base until the
Potomac, below Washington, should be freed from
the Confederate batteries; that any movement of
the army via Chesapeake Bay should begin as
early as March 18, and that the general-in-chief
should be &quot;responsible that it moves as early as
that day.&quot; This greatly aggravated McClellan's
dissatisfaction; for it expressed the survival of
the President's anxiety, it hampered the general,
and by its last clause it placed upon him a responsibility
not properly his own.</p>

<p>Yet at this very moment weighty evidence came
to impeach the soundness of McClellan's opinion
concerning the military situation. On February
27 Secretary Chase wrote that the time had come
for dealing decisively with the &quot;army in front of
us,&quot; which he conceived to be already so weakened
that &quot;a victory over it is deprived of half its
honor.&quot; Not many days after this writing, the
civilian strategists, the President and his friends,
seemed entitled to triumph. For on March 7, 8,
and 9 the North was astonished by news of the
evacuation of Manassas by Johnston. At once
<!-- Image No 370 --><a name='Png370'></a><a name='Page342'></a><span class="pagenum">342</span>
the cry of McClellan's assailants went up: If
McClellan had only moved upon the place! What
a cheap victory he would have won, and attended
with what invaluable &quot;moral effects&quot;! Yet, forsooth,
he had been afraid to move upon these
very intrenched positions which it now appeared
that the Confederates dared not hold even when
unthreatened! But McClellan retorted that the
rebels had taken this backward step precisely because
they had got some hint of his designs for
advancing by Urbana, and that it was the exact
fulfillment, though inconveniently premature, of
his predictions. This explanation, however, wholly
failed to prevent the civilian mind from believing
that a great point had been scored on behalf of
the President's plan. Further than this, there
were many persons, including even a majority of
the members of the Committee on the Conduct
of the War, who did not content themselves with
mere abuse of McClellan's military intelligence,
but who actually charged him with being disaffected
and nearly, if not quite, a traitor. None
the less Mr. Lincoln generously and patiently
adhered to his agreement to let McClellan have
his own way.</p>

<p>Precisely at the same time that this evacuation
of Manassas gave to McClellan's enemies an argument
against him which they deemed fair and
forcible and he deemed unfair and ignorant, two
other occurrences added to the strain of the situation.
McClellan immediately put his entire force
<!-- Image No 371 --><a name='Png371'></a><a name='Page343'></a><span class="pagenum">343</span>
in motion towards the lines abandoned by the Confederates,
not with the design of pressing the retreating
foe, which the &quot;almost impassable roads&quot;
prevented, but to strip off redundancies and to
train the troops in marching. On March 11, immediately
after he had started, the President issued
his Special War Order No. 3: &quot;Major-General
McClellan having personally taken the field at
the head of the army of the Potomac,... he is
relieved from the command of the other military
departments, he retaining command of the Department
of the Potomac.&quot; McClellan at once wrote
that he should continue to &quot;work just as cheerfully
as before;&quot; but he felt that the removal was very
unhandsomely made just as he was entering upon
active operations. Lincoln, on the other hand, undoubtedly
looked upon it in precisely the opposite
light, and conceived that the opportunity of the
moment deprived of any apparent sting a change
which he had determined to make. The duties
which were thus taken from McClellan were assumed
during several months by Mr. Stanton. He
was utterly incompetent for them, and, whether or
not it was wise to displace the general, it was certainly
very unwise to let the secretary practically
succeed him.<a name='FNanchor_165_167'></a><a href='#Footnote_165_167'><sup>[165]</sup></a>
 The way in which, both at the East
and West, our forces were distributed into many
independent commands, with no competent chief
who could compel all to co&ouml;perate and to become
subsidiary to one comprehensive scheme, was a
<!-- Image No 372 --><a name='Png372'></a><a name='Page344'></a><span class="pagenum">344</span>
serious mistake in general policy, which cost very
dear before it was recognized.<a name='FNanchor_166_168'></a><a href='#Footnote_166_168'><sup>[166]</sup></a>
 McClellan had
made some efforts to effect this combination or
unity in purpose, but Stanton gave no indication
even of understanding that it was desirable.</p>

<p>The other matter was the division of the army
of the Potomac into four army corps, to be commanded
respectively by the four senior generals
of division, viz., McDowell, Sumner, Heintzelman,
and Keyes. The propriety of this action had
been for some time under consideration, and the
step was now forced upon Mr. Lincoln by the
strenuous insistence of the Committee on the Conduct
of the War. That so large an army required
organization by corps was admitted; but McClellan
had desired to defer the arrangement until his
generals of division should have had some actual
experience in the field, whereby their comparative
fitness for higher responsibilities could be
measured. An incapable corps commander was a
much more dangerous man than an incapable commander
of a division or brigade. The commander
naturally felt the action now taken by the President
to be a slight, and he attributed it to
pressure by the band of civilian advisers whose
untiring hostility he returned with unutterable
contempt. Not only was the taking of the step at
this time contrary to his advice, but he was not
even consulted in the selection of his own subordinates,
<!-- Image No 373 --><a name='Png373'></a><a name='Page345'></a><span class="pagenum">345</span>
who were set in these important positions by
the blind rule of seniority, and not in accordance
with his opinion of comparative merit. His irritation
was perhaps not entirely unjustifiable.</p>

 In fact, the feeling against McClellan was getting so strong
that some of his enemies were wild enough about this time to
accuse him of disloyalty. He himself narrates a dramatic tale,
which would seem incredible if his veracity were not beyond
question, of an interview, occurring March 8, 1862, in which the
President told him, apparently with the air of expecting an explanation,
that he was charged with laying his plans with the
traitorous intent of leaving Washington defenseless. McClellan's
<i>Own Story</i>, 195. On the other hand, McClellan retaliated by believing
that his detractors wished, for political and personal motives,
to prevent the war from being brought to an early and
successful close, and that they intentionally withheld from him
the means of success; also that Stanton especially sought by underhand
means to sow misunderstanding between him and the
President. <i>Ibid.</i> 195.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h2>MILITARY MATTERS OUTSIDE OF VIRGINIA</h2>

<p>The man who first raised the cry &quot;On to Richmond!&quot;
uttered the formula of the war. Richmond
was the gage of victory. Thus it happened,
as has been seen, that every one at the North,
from the President down, had his attention fast
bound to the melancholy procession of delays and
miscarriages in Virginia. At the West there
were important things to be done; the States of
Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri, trembling in
the balance, were to be lost or won for the Union;
the passage down the Mississippi to the Gulf was
at stake, and with it the prosperity and development
of the boundless regions of the Northwest.
Surely these were interests of some moment, and
worthy of liberal expenditure of thought and energy,
men and money; yet the swarm of politicians
gave them only side glances, being unable for
many minutes in any day to withdraw their eyes
from the Old Dominion. The consequence was
that at the East matters military and matters political,
generals and &quot;public men&quot; of all varieties
were mixed in a snarl of backbiting and quarreling,
which presented a spectacle most melancholy
<!-- Image No 375 --><a name='Png375'></a><a name='Page347'></a><span class="pagenum">347</span>
and discouraging. On the other hand, the West
throve surprisingly well in the absence of political
nourishment, and certain local commanders
achieved cheering successes without any aid from
the military civilians of Washington. The contrast
seems suggestive, yet perhaps it is incorrect
to attach to these facts any sinister significance, or
any connection of cause and effect. Other reasons
than civilian assistance may account for the Virginia
failures, while Western successes may have
been won in spite of neglect rather than by reason
of it. Still, simply as naked facts, these things
were so.</p>

<p>Upon occurrences outside of Virginia Mr. Lincoln
bestowed more thought than was fashionable
in Washington, and maintained an oversight
strongly in contrast to the indifference of those
who seemed to recognize no other duty than to
discuss the demerits of General McClellan. The
President had at least the good sense to see the
value of unity of plan and co&ouml;peration along the
whole line, from the Atlantic seaboard to the extreme
West. Also at the West as at the East he
was bent upon advancing, pressing the enemy,
and doing something positive. He had not occasion
to use the spur at the West either so often or
so severely as at the East; yet Halleck and Buell
needed it and got it more than once. The Western
commanders, like those at the East, and with
better reason, were importunate for more men and
more equipment. The President could not, by
<!-- Image No 376 --><a name='Png376'></a><a name='Page348'></a><span class="pagenum">348</span>
any effort, meet their requirements. He wrote to
McClernand after the battle of Belmont: &quot;Much,
very much, goes undone; but it is because we have
not the power to do it faster than we do.&quot; Some
troops were without arms; but, he said, &quot;the plain
matter of fact is, our good people have rushed to
the rescue of the government faster than the government
can find arms to put in their hands.&quot;
Yet, withal, it is true that Mr. Lincoln's actual
interferences at the South and West were so occasional
and incidental, that, since this writing is a
biography of him and not a history of the war,
there is need only for a list of the events which
were befalling outside of that absorbing domain
which lay around the rival capitals.</p>

<p>Along the southern Atlantic coast some rather
easy successes were rapidly won. August 29,
1861, Hatteras Inlet was taken, with little fighting.
November 7, Port Royal followed. Lying
nearly midway between Charleston and Savannah,
and being a very fine harbor, this was a prize of
value. January 7, 1862, General Burnside was
directed to take command of the Department of
North Carolina. February 8, Roanoke Island was
seized by the Federal forces. March 14, Newbern
fell. April 11, Fort Pulaski, at the mouth
of the Savannah River, was taken. April 26,
Beaufort was occupied. The blockade of the
other Atlantic ports having long since been made
effective, the Eastern seaboard thus early became
a prison wall for the Confederacy.</p>

At the extreme West Missouri gave the President
some trouble. The bushwhacking citizens of
that frontier State, divided not unequally between
the Union and Disunion sides, entered upon an
irregular but energetic warfare with ready zeal if
not actually with pleasure. Northerners in general
hardly paused to read the newspaper accounts
of these rough encounters, but the President was
much concerned to save the State. As it lay over
against Illinois along the banks of the Mississippi
River, and for the most part above the important
strategic point where Cairo controls the junction
of that river with the Ohio, possession of it appeared
to him exceedingly desirable. In the hope
of helping matters forward, on July 3, 1861, he
created the Department of the West, and placed
it under command of General Fremont. But the
choice proved unfortunate. Fremont soon showed
himself inefficient and troublesome. At first the
President endeavored to allay the local bickerings;
on September 9, 1861, he wrote to General
Hunter: &quot;General Fremont needs assistance
which it is difficult to give him. He is losing the
confidence of men near him.... His cardinal
mistake is that he isolates himself;... he does
not know what is going on.... He needs to have
by his side a man of large experience. Will you
not, for me, take that place? Your rank is one
grade too high;... but will you not serve the
country, and oblige me, by taking it voluntarily?&quot;
Kindly consideration, however, was thrown away
<!-- Image No 378 --><a name='Png378'></a><a name='Page350'></a><span class="pagenum">350</span>
upon Fremont, whose self-esteem was so great that
he could not see that he ought to be grateful, or
that he must be subordinate. He owed his appointment
largely to the friendly urgency of the
Blair family; and now Postmaster-General Blair,
puzzled at the disagreeable stories about him, went
to St. Louis on an errand of investigation. Fremont
promptly placed him under arrest. At the
same time Mrs. Fremont was journeying to Washington,
where she had an extraordinary interview
with the President. &quot;She sought an audience
with me at midnight,&quot; wrote Lincoln, &quot;and taxed
me so violently with many things that I had to
exercise all the awkward tact I have to avoid
quarreling with her.... She more than once
intimated that if General Fremont should decide
to try conclusions with me, he could set up for
himself.&quot; Naturally the angry lady's threats of
treason, instead of seeming a palliation of her
husband's shortcomings, tended to make his displacement
more inevitable. Yet the necessity of
being rid of him was unfortunate, because he was
the pet hero of the Abolitionists, who stood by
him without the slightest regard to reason. Lincoln
was loath to offend them, but he felt that he
had no choice, and therefore ordered the removal.
He preserved, however, that habitual strange freedom
from personal resentment which made his
feelings, like his action, seem to be strictly official.
After the matter was all over he uttered a fair
judgment: &quot;I thought well of Fremont. Even
<!-- Image No 379 --><a name='Png379'></a><a name='Page351'></a><span class="pagenum">351</span>
now I think well of his impulses. I only think
he is the prey of wicked and designing men; and
I think he has absolutely no military capacity.&quot;
For a short while General Hunter filled Fremont's
place, until, in November, General Henry W.
Halleck was assigned to command the Department
of Missouri. In February, 1862, General Curtis
drove the only regular and considerable rebel force
across the border into Arkansas; and soon afterward,
March 7 and 8, within this latter State, he
won the victory of Pea Ridge.</p>

<p>In Tennessee the vote upon secession had indicated
that more than two thirds of the dwellers
in the mountainous eastern region were Unionists.
Mr. Lincoln had it much at heart to sustain these
men, and aside from the personal feeling of loyalty
to them it was also a point of great military consequence
to hold this district. Near the boundary
separating the northeastern corner of the State
from Kentucky, the famous Cumberland Gap gave
passage through the Cumberland Mountains for
the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad, &quot;the
artery that supplied the rebellion.&quot; The President
saw, as many others did, and appreciated
much more than others seemed to do, the desirability
of gaining this place. To hold it would be
to cut in halves, between east and west, the northern
line of the Confederacy. In the early days a
movement towards the Gap seemed imprudent in
face of Kentucky's theory of &quot;neutrality.&quot; But
this foolish notion was in time effectually disposed
<!-- Image No 380 --><a name='Png380'></a><a name='Page352'></a><span class="pagenum">352</span>
of by the Confederates. Unable to resist the
temptation offered by the important position of
Columbus at the western end of the State on the
Mississippi River, they seized that place in September,
1861. The state legislature, incensed at
the intrusion, immediately embraced the Union
cause and welcomed the Union forces within the
state lines.</p>

<p>This action opened the way for the President to
make strenuous efforts for the protection of the
East Tennesseeans and the possession of the Gap.
In his annual message he urged upon Congress
the construction of a military railroad to the Gap,
and afterward appeared in person to advocate this
measure before a committee of the Senate. If the
place had been in Virginia, he might have gained
for his project an attention which, as matters
stood, the politicians never accorded to it. He
also endeavored to stir to action General Buell,
who commanded in Kentucky. Buell, an appointee
and personal friend of General McClellan,
resembled his chief somewhat too closely both in
character and history. Just as Mr. Lincoln had
to prick McClellan in Virginia, he now had to
prick Buell in Kentucky; and just as McClellan,
failed to respond in Virginia, Buell also failed in
Kentucky. Further, Buell, like McClellan, had
with him a force very much greater than that
before him; but Buell, like McClellan, would not
admit that his troops were in condition to move.
The result was that Jefferson Davis, more active
<!-- Image No 381 --><a name='Png381'></a><a name='Page353'></a><span class="pagenum">353</span>
to protect a crucial point than the North was to
assail it, in December, 1861, sent into East Tennessee
a force which imprisoned, deported, and
hanged the loyal residents there, harried the country
without mercy, and held it with the iron hand.
The poor mountaineers, with good reason, concluded
that the hostility of the South was a terribly
serious evil, whereas the friendship of the
North was a sadly useless good. The President
was bitterly chagrined, although certainly the
blame did not rest with him. Then the parallel
between Buell and McClellan was continued even
one step farther; for Buell at last intimated that
he did not approve of the plan of campaign suggested
for him, but thought it would be better
tactics to move upon Nashville. It so happened,
however, that when he expressed these views McClellan
was commander-in-chief of all the armies,
and that general, being little tolerant of criticism
from subordinates when he himself was the superior,
responded very tartly and imperiously. Lincoln,
on the other hand, according to his wont,
wrote modestly: &quot;Your dispatch ... disappoints
and distresses me.... I am not competent to
criticise your views.&quot; Then, in the rest of the letter,
he maintained with convincing clearness both
the military and the political soundness of his own
opinions.</p>

<p>In offset of this disappointment caused by Buell's
inaction, the western end of Kentucky became
the theatre of gratifying operations. So soon as
<!-- Image No 382 --><a name='Png382'></a><a name='Page354'></a><span class="pagenum">354</span>
policy ceased to compel recognition of the &quot;neutrality&quot;
of the State, General Grant, on September
6, 1861, entered Paducah at the confluence of
the Ohio and Tennessee rivers. By this move he
checked the water communication hitherto freely
used by the rebels, and neutralized the advantage
which they had expected to gain by their possession
of Columbus. But this was only a first and
easy step. Farther to the southward, just within
the boundaries of Tennessee, lay Fort Henry on the
Tennessee River and Fort Donelson on the Cumberland,
presenting a kind of temptation which
Grant was less able to resist than were most of
the Union generals at this time. Accordingly he
arranged with Admiral Foote, who commanded
the new gunboats on the Mississippi, for a joint
excursion against these places. On February 6,
Fort Henry fell, chiefly through the work of the
river navy. Ten days later, February 16, Fort
Donelson was taken, the laurels on this occasion
falling to the land forces. Floyd and Pillow were
in the place when the Federals came to it, but
when they saw that capture was inevitable they
furtively slipped away, and thus shifted upon General
Buckner the humiliation of the surrender.
This mean behavior excited the bitter resentment
of that general, which was not alleviated by what
followed. For when he proposed to discuss terms
of capitulation, General Grant made that famous
reply which gave rise to his popular nickname:
&quot;No terms except unconditional and immediate
<!-- Image No 383 --><a name='Png383'></a><a name='Page355'></a><span class="pagenum">355</span>
surrender can be accepted. I propose to move
immediately upon your works.&quot;</p>

<p>Halleck telegraphed the pleasant news that the
capture of Fort Donelson carried with it &quot;12,000
to 15,000 prisoners, including Generals Buckner
and Bushrod R. Johnson, also about 20,000 stands
of arms, 48 pieces of artillery, 17 heavy guns,
from 2000 to 4000 horses, and large quantities
of commissary stores.&quot; He also advised: &quot;Make
Buell, Grant, and Pope major-generals of volunteers,
and give me command in the West. I ask
this in return for Forts Henry and Donelson.&quot;
Halleck was one of those who expect to reap
where others sow. The achievements of Grant
and Foote also led him, by some strange process
of reasoning, to conclude that General C.W.
Smith was the most able general in his department.</p>

<p>Congress, highly gratified at these cheering
events, ordered a grand illumination at Washington
for February 22; but the death of the President's
little son, at the White House, a day or
two before that date, checked a rejoicing which
in other respects also would not have been altogether
timely.</p>

<p>The Federal possession of these two forts rendered
Columbus untenable for the Confederates,
and on March 2 they evacuated it. This was followed
by the fall of New Madrid on March 13,
and of Island No. 10 on April 7. At the latter
place between 6000 and 7000 Confederates surrendered.
<!-- Image No 384 --><a name='Png384'></a><a name='Page356'></a><span class="pagenum">356</span>
Thus was the Federal wedge being
driven steadily deeper down the channel of the
Mississippi.</p>

<p>Soon after this good service of the gunboats on
the Western rivers, the salt-water navy came in for
its share of glory. On March 8 the ram Virginia,
late Merrimac, which had been taking on her mysterious
iron raiment at the Norfolk navy yard,
issued from her concealment, an ugly and clumsy,
but also a novel and terrible monster. Straight
she steamed against the frigate Cumberland, and
with one fell rush cut the poor wooden vessel in
halves and sent her, with all on board, to the
bottom of the sea. Turning then, she mercilessly
battered the frigate Congress, drove her ashore,
and burned her. All this while the shot which
had rained upon her iron sides had rolled off harmless,
and she returned to her anchorage, having her
prow broken by impact with the Cumberland, but
otherwise unhurt. Her armor had stood the test,
and now the Federal government contemplated with
grave anxiety the further possible achievements
of this strange and potent destroyer.</p>

<p>But the death of the Merrimac was to follow
close upon her birth; she was the portent of a few
weeks only. For, during a short time past, there
had been also rapidly building in a Connecticut
yard the Northern marvel, the famous Monitor.
When the ingenious Swede, John Ericsson, proposed
his scheme for an impregnable floating battery,
his hearers were divided between distrust
<!-- Image No 385 --><a name='Png385'></a><a name='Page357'></a><span class="pagenum">357</span>
and hope; but fortunately the President's favorable
opinion secured the trial of the experiment.
The work was zealously pushed, and the artisans
actually went to sea with the craft in order to
finish her as she made her voyage southward. It
was well that such haste was made, for she came
into Hampton Roads actually by the light of the
burning Congress. On the next day, being Sunday,
March 9, the Southern monster again steamed
forth, intending this time to make the Minnesota
her prey; but a little boat, that looked like a
&quot;cheese-box&quot; afloat, pushed forward to interfere
with this plan. Then occurred a duel which, in
the annals of naval science, ranks as the most important
engagement which ever took place. It did
not actually result in the destruction of the Merrimac
then and there, for, though much battered,
she was able to make her way back to the friendly
shelter of the Norfolk yard. But she was more
than neutralized; it was evident that the Monitor
was the better craft of the two, and that in a
combat <i>&agrave; outrance</i> she would win. The significance
of this day's work on the waters of Virginia
cannot be exaggerated. By the armor-clad Merrimac
and the Monitor there was accomplished in
the course of an hour a revolution which differentiated
the naval warfare of the past from that
of the future by a chasm as great as that which
separated the ancient Greek trireme from the flagship
of Lord Nelson.</p>

<p>As early as the middle of November, 1861, Mr.
<!-- Image No 386 --><a name='Png386'></a><a name='Page358'></a><span class="pagenum">358</span>
Lincoln was discussing the feasibility of capturing
New Orleans. Already Ship Island, off the Mississippi
coast, with its uncompleted equipment, had
been seized as a Gulf station, and could be used as
a base. The naval force was prepared as rapidly
as possible, but it was not until February 3 that
Captain Farragut, the commander of the expedition,
steamed out of Hampton Roads in his flagship,
the screw steam sloop Hartford. On April
18 he began to bombard forts St. Philip and Jackson,
which lie on the river banks seventy-five miles
below New Orleans, guarding the approach. Soon,
becoming impatient of this tardy process, he resolved
upon the bold and original enterprise of
running by the forts. This he achieved in the
night of April 24; and on April 27 the stars and
stripes floated over the Mint in New Orleans.
Still two days of shilly-shallying on the part of
the mayor ensued, delaying a formal surrender,
until Farragut, who had no fancy for nonsense,
sharply put a stop to it, and New Orleans, in form
and substance, passed under Northern control. On
April 28 the two forts, isolated by what had taken
place, surrendered. On May 1 General Butler
began in the city that efficient r&eacute;gime which so
exasperated the men of the South. On May 7
Baton Rouge, the state capital, was occupied, without
resistance; and Natchez followed in the procession
on May 12.</p>

Union army not far from the riverside in Kentucky
and Tennessee, the opening and repossession
of the whole stream by the Federals became a
thing which ought soon to be achieved. On June
5 the gunboat fleet from up the river came down
to within two miles of Memphis, engaged in a hard
fight and won a complete victory, and on the next
day Memphis was held by the Union troops. Farragut
also, working in his usual style, forced his
way up to Vicksburg, and exchanged shots with the
Confederate batteries on the bluffs. He found,
however, that without the co&ouml;peration of a land
force he could do nothing, and had to drop back
again to New Orleans, arriving there on June 1.
In a few weeks he returned in stronger force, and
on June 27 he was bombarding the rebel works.
On June 28, repeating the operation which had
been so successful below New Orleans, he ran some
of his vessels by the batteries and got above the
city. But there was still no army on the land, and
so the vessels which had run by, up stream, had to
make the dangerous gauntlet again, down stream,
and a second time the fleet descended to New Orleans.</p>

<p>General Halleck had arrived at St. Louis on
November 18, 1861, to take command of the Western
Department. Perhaps a more energetic commander
would have been found ready to co&ouml;perate
with Farragut at Vicksburg by the end of June,
1862; for matters had been going excellently with
the Unionists northeast of that place, and it would
<!-- Image No 390 --><a name='Png390'></a><a name='Page360'></a><span class="pagenum">360</span>
seem that a powerful and victorious army might
have been moving thither during that month.
Early in March, however, General Halleck reported
that Grant's army was as much demoralized
by victory as the army at Bull Run had been by
defeat. He said that Grant &quot;richly deserved&quot;
censure, and that he himself was worn out by
Grant's neglect and inefficiency. By such charges
he obtained from McClellan orders relieving General
Grant from duty, ordering an investigation,
and even authorizing his arrest. But a few days
later, March 13, more correct information caused
the reversal of these orders, and March 17 found
Grant again in command. He at once began to
busy himself with arrangements for moving upon
Corinth. General Buell meanwhile, after sustaining
McClellan's rebuke and being taught his place,
had afterward been successful in obtaining for his
own plan preference over that of the administration,
had easily possessed himself of Nashville toward
the end of February, and was now ready to
march westward and co&ouml;perate with General Grant
in this enterprise. Corinth, lying just across the
Mississippi border, was &quot;the great strategic position&quot;
at this part of the West. The Mobile and
Ohio Railroad ran through it north and south; the
Memphis and Charleston Railroad passed through
east and west. If it could be taken and held, it
would leave, as the only connection open through
the Confederacy from the Mississippi River to the
Atlantic coast, the railroad line which started from
<!-- Image No 391 --><a name='Png391'></a><a name='Page361'></a><span class="pagenum">361</span>
Vicksburg. The Confederates also had shown their
estimation of Corinth by fortifying it strongly, and
manifesting plainly their determination to fight a
great battle to hold it. Grant, aiming towards it,
had his army at Pittsburg Landing, on the west
bank of the Tennessee, and there awaited Buell,
who was moving thither from Nashville with
40,000 men. Such being the status, Grant expected
General A.S. Johnston to await in his
intrenchments the assault of the Union army.
But Johnston, in an aggressive mood, laid well
and boldly his plan to whip Grant before Buell
could join him, then to whip Buell, and, having
thus disposed of the Northern forces in detail, to
carry the war up to, or even across, the Ohio. So
he came suddenly out from Corinth and marched
straight upon Pittsburg Landing, and precipitated
that famous battle which has been named after the
church of Shiloh, because about that church the
most desperate and bloody fighting was done.</p>

<p>The conflict began on Sunday, April 6, and
lasted all day. There was not much plan about
it; the troops went at each other somewhat indiscriminately
and did simple stubborn fighting. The
Federals lost much ground all along their line, and
were crowded back towards the river. Some say
that the Confederates closed that day on the way
to victory; but General Grant says that he felt
assured of winning on Monday, and that he instructed
all his division commanders to open with
an assault in the morning. The doubt, if doubt
<!-- Image No 392 --><a name='Png392'></a><a name='Page362'></a><span class="pagenum">362</span>
there was, was settled by the arrival of General
Buell, whose fresh forces, coming in as good an
hour as the Prussians came at Waterloo, were put
in during the evening upon the Federal left. On
Sunday the Confederates had greatly outnumbered
the Federals, but this reinforcement reversed the
proportions, so that on Monday the Federals were
in the greater force. Again the conflict was fierce
and obstinate, but again the greater numbers
whipped the smaller, and by afternoon the Confederates
were in full retreat. Shiloh, says General
Grant, &quot;was the severest battle fought at
the West during the war, and but few in the East
equaled it for hard, determined fighting.&quot; It
ended in a complete Union victory. General A.S.
Johnston was killed and Beauregard retreated
to Corinth, while the North first exulted because
he was compelled to do so, and then grumbled because
he was allowed to do so. It was soon said
that Grant had been surprised, that he was entitled
to no credit for winning clumsily a battle which he
had not expected to fight, and that he was blameworthy
for not following up the retreating foe
more sharply. The discussion survives among
those quarrels of the war in which the disputants
have fought over again the contested field, with
harmless fierceness, and without any especial result.
Congress took up the dispute, and did a vast deal
of talking, in the course of which there occurred
one sensible remark. This was made by Mr. Richardson
of Illinois, who said that the armies would
<!-- Image No 393 --><a name='Png393'></a><a name='Page363'></a><span class="pagenum">363</span>
get along much better if the Riot Act could be
read, and the members of Congress dispersed and
sent home.</p>

<p>General Grant found that General Halleck was
even more obstinately in the way of his winning
any success than were the Confederates themselves.
As commander of the department, Halleck now
conceived that it was his fair privilege to do the
visible taking of that conspicuous prize which his
lieutenant had brought within sure reach. Accordingly,
on April 11, he arrived and assumed
command for the purpose of moving on Corinth.
Still he was sedulous in his endeavors to neglect,
suppress, and even insult General Grant, whom
he put nominally second in command, but practically
reduced to insignificance, until Grant, finding
his position &quot;unendurable,&quot; asked to be relieved.
This conduct on the part of Halleck has
of course been attributed to jealousy; but more
probably it was due chiefly to the personal prejudice
of a dull man, perhaps a little stimulated
by a natural desire for reputation. Having taken
charge of the advance, he conducted it slowly and
cautiously, intrenching as he went, and moving
with pick and shovel, in the phrase of General
Sherman, who commanded a division in the army.
&quot;The movement,&quot; says General Grant, &quot;was a
siege from the start to the close.&quot; Such tactics
had not hitherto been tried at the West, and apparently
did not meet approval. There were only
about twenty-two miles to be traversed, yet four
<!-- Image No 394 --><a name='Png394'></a><a name='Page364'></a><span class="pagenum">364</span>
weeks elapsed in the process. The army started
on April 30; twice Pope got near the enemy, first
on May 4, and again on May 8, and each time
he was ordered back. It was actually May 28,
according to General Grant, when &quot;the investment
of Corinth was complete, or as complete as it was
ever made.&quot; But already, on May 26, Beauregard
had issued orders for evacuating the place,
which was accomplished with much skill. On
May 30 Halleck drew up his army in battle array
and &quot;announced in orders that there was every
indication that our left was to be attacked that
morning.&quot; A few hours later his troops marched
unopposed into empty works.</p>

<p>Halleck now commanded in Corinth a powerful
army,&mdash;the forces of Grant, Buell, and Pope,
combined,&mdash;not far from 100,000 strong, and he
was threatened by no Southern force at all able
to face him. According to the views of General
Grant, he had great opportunities; and among
these certainly was the advance of a strong column
upon Vicksburg. If he could be induced to do
this, it seemed reasonable to expect that he and
Farragut together would be able to open the whole
Mississippi River, and to cut the last remaining
east-and-west line of railroad communication. But
he did nothing, and ultimately the disposition
made of this splendid collection of troops was to
distribute and dissipate it in such a manner that
the loss of the points already gained became much
more probable than the acquisition of others.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 395 --><a name='Png395'></a><a name='Page365'></a><span class="pagenum">365</span>
Early in July, as has been elsewhere said, Halleck
was called to Washington to take the place
of general-in-chief of all the armies of the North;
and at this point perhaps it is worth while to devote
a paragraph to comparing the retirement of
McClellan with the promotion of Halleck. Some
similarities and dissimilarities in their careers are
striking. The dissimilarities were: that McClellan
had organized the finest army which the country
had yet seen, or was to see; also that he had
at least made a plan for a great campaign; and he
had not suppressed any one abler than himself;
that Halleck on the other hand had done little
to organize an army or to plan a campaign, had
failed to find out the qualities of General W.T.
Sherman, who was in his department, and had
done all in his power to drive General Grant into
retirement. The similarities are more worthy of
observation. Each general had wearied the administration
with demands for reinforcements when
each already outnumbered his opponent so much
that it was almost disgraceful to desire to increase
the odds. If McClellan had been reprehensibly
slow in moving upon Yorktown, and had blundered
by besieging instead of trying an assault,
certainly the snail-like approach upon Corinth had
been equally deliberate and wasteful of time and
opportunity; and if McClellan had marched into
deserted intrenchments, so also had Halleck. If
McClellan had captured &quot;Quaker guns&quot; at Manassas,
Halleck had found the like peaceful weapons
<!-- Image No 396 --><a name='Png396'></a><a name='Page366'></a><span class="pagenum">366</span>
frowning from the ramparts of Corinth. If
McClellan had held inactive a powerful force when
it ought to have been marching to Manassas, Halleck
had also held inactive another powerful force,
a part of which might have helped to take Vicksburg.
If the records of these two men were stated
in parallel columns, it would be difficult to see
why one should have been taken and the other
left. But the explanation exists and is instructive,
and it is wholly for the sake of the explanation
that the comparison has been made. McClellan
was &quot;in politics,&quot; and Halleck was not;
McClellan, therefore, had a host of active, unsparing
enemies in Washington, which Halleck had
not; the Virginia field of operations was ceaselessly
and microscopically inspected; the Western
field attracted occasional glances not conducive to
a full knowledge. Halleck, as commander in a department
where victories were won, seemed to have
won the victories, and no politicians cared to deny
his right to the glory; whereas the politicians,
whose hatred of McClellan had, by the admission
of one of themselves, become a mania,<a name='FNanchor_167_169'></a><a href='#Footnote_167_169'><sup>[167]</sup></a>
 were entirely
happy to have any one set over his head,
and would not imperil their pleasure by too close
an inspection of the new aspirant's merits. These
remarks are not designed to have any significance
upon the merits or demerits of McClellan, which
have been elsewhere discussed, nor upon the merits
or demerits of Halleck, which are not worth discussing;
<!-- Image No 397 --><a name='Png397'></a><a name='Page367'></a><span class="pagenum">367</span>
but they are made simply because they
afford so forcible an illustration of certain important
conditions at Washington at this time. The
truth is that the ensnarlment of the Eastern military
affairs with politics made success in that field
impossible for the North. The condition made it
practically inevitable that a Union commander in
Virginia should have his thoughts at least as much
occupied with the members of Congress in the capital
behind him as with the Confederate soldiers in
camp before him. Such division of his attention
was ruinous. At and before the outbreak of the
rebellion the South had expected to be aided
efficiently by a great body of sympathizers at the
North. As yet they had been disappointed in this;
but almost simultaneously with this disappointment
they were surprised by a valuable and unexpected
assistance, growing out of the open feuds, the covert
malice, the bad blood, the partisanship, and
the wire-pulling introduced by the loyal political
fraternity into campaigning business. The quarreling
politicians were doing, very efficiently, the
work which Southern sympathizers had been expected
to do.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h2>FOREIGN AFFAIRS</h2>

<p>To the people who had been engaged in changing
Illinois from a wilderness into a civilized State,
Europe had been an abstraction, a mere colored
spot upon a map, which in their lives meant nothing.
Though England had been the home of
their ancestors, it was really less interesting than
the west coast of Africa, which was the home of
the negroes; for the negroes were just now of
vastly more consequence than the ancestors. So
even Dahomey had some claim to be regarded as
a more important place than Great Britain, and
the early settlers wasted little thought on the
affairs of Queen Victoria. Amid these conditions,
absorbed even more than his neighbors in the
exciting questions of domestic politics, and having
no tastes or pursuits which guided his thoughts
abroad, Mr. Lincoln had never had occasion to
consider the foreign relations of the United States,
up to the time when he was suddenly obliged to
take an active part in managing them.</p>

<p>At an early stage of the civil dissensions each
side hoped for the good-will of England. For
obvious reasons, that island counted to the United
<!-- Image No 399 --><a name='Png399'></a><a name='Page369'></a><span class="pagenum">369</span>
States for more than the whole continent of Europe;
indeed, the continental nations were likely
to await and to follow her lead. Southern orators,
advocating secession, assured their hearers
that &quot;King Cotton&quot; would be the supreme power,
and would compel that realm of spinners and
weavers to friendship if not to alliance with the
Confederacy. Northern men, on the other hand,
expressed confidence that a people with the record
of Englishmen against slavery would not countenance
a war conducted in behalf of that institution;
nor did they allow their hopes to be at all
impaired by the consideration that, in order to
found them upon this support, they had to overlook
the fact that they were at the same time distinctly
declaring that slavery really had nothing
to do with the war, in which only and strictly the
question of the Union, the integrity of the nation,
was at stake. When the issue was pressing for
actual decision, each side was disappointed; and
each found that it had counted upon a motive
which fell far short of exerting the anticipated influence.
It was, of course, the case that England
suffered much from the short supply of cotton;
but she made shift to procure it elsewhere, while
the working people, sympathizing with the North,
were surprisingly patient. Thus the political pressure
arising from commercial distress was much
less than had been expected, and the South learned
that cotton was only a spurious monarch. Not
less did the North find itself deceived; for the
<!-- Image No 400 --><a name='Png400'></a><a name='Page370'></a><span class="pagenum">370</span>
upper and middle classes of Great Britain appeared
absolutely indifferent to the humanitarian
element which, as they were assured, underlay the
struggle. Perhaps they were not to be blamed for
setting aside these assurances, and accepting in
place thereof the belief that the American leaders
spoke the truth when they solemnly told the North
that the question at issue was purely and simply of
&quot;the Union.&quot; The unfortunate fact was that it
was necessary to say one thing to Englishmen and
a different thing to Americans.</p>

<p>That which really did inspire the feelings and
the wishes, and which did influence, though it
could not be permitted fully to control, the action
of England, had not been counted upon by either
section of the country; perhaps its existence had
not been appreciated. This was the intense dislike
felt for the American republic by nearly all
Englishmen who were above the social grade of
mechanics and mill operatives. The extent and
force of this antipathy and even contempt were
for the first time given free expression under the
irresistible provocation which arose out of the delightful
likelihood of the destruction of the United
States. The situation at least gave to the people
of that imperiled country a chance to find out in
what estimation they were held across the water.
The behavior of the English government and the
attitude of the English press during the early part
of the civil war have been ascribed by different
historians to one or another dignified political or
<!-- Image No 401 --><a name='Png401'></a><a name='Page371'></a><span class="pagenum">371</span>
commercial motive. But while these influences
were certainly not absent, yet the English newspapers
poured an inundating flood of evidence
to show that genuine and deep-seated dislike, not
to say downright hatred, was by very much the
principal motive. This truth is so painful and unfortunate
that many have thought best to suppress
or deny it; but no historian is entitled to use such
discretion. From an early period, therefore, in
the administration of Mr. Lincoln, he and Mr.
Seward had to endeavor to preserve friendly relations
with a power which, if she could only make
entirely sure of the worldly wisdom of yielding to
her wishes, would instantly recognize the independence
of the South. This being the case, it was
matter for regret that the rules of international
law concerning blockades, contraband of war, and
rights of neutrals were perilously vague and unsettled.</p>

<p>Earl<a name='FNanchor_168_170'></a><a href='#Footnote_168_170'><sup>[168]</sup></a>
 Russell was at this time in charge of
her majesty's foreign affairs. Because in matters
domestic he was liberal-minded, Americans had
been inclined to expect his good-will; but he now
disappointed them by appearing to share the prejudices
of his class against the republic. A series
of events soon revealed his temper. So soon as
there purported to be a Confederacy, an understanding
had been reached betwixt him and the
French emperor that both powers should take the
<!-- Image No 402 --><a name='Png402'></a><a name='Page372'></a><span class="pagenum">372</span>
same course as to recognizing it. About May 1
he admitted three Southern commissioners to an
audience with him, though not &quot;officially.&quot; May
13 there was published a proclamation, whereby
Queen Victoria charged and commanded all her
&quot;loving subjects to observe a strict neutrality&quot; in
and during the hostilities which had &quot;unhappily
commenced between the government of the United
States and certain States styling themselves 'the
Confederate States of America.'&quot; This action&mdash;
this assumption of a position of &quot;neutrality,&quot; as
between enemies&mdash;taken while the &quot;hostilities&quot;
had extended only to the single incident of Fort
Sumter, gave surprise and some offense to the
North. It was a recognition of belligerency; that
is to say, while not in any other respect recognizing
the revolting States as an independent power,
it accorded to them the rights of a belligerent.
The magnitude very quickly reached by the struggle
would have made this step necessary and
proper, so that, if England had only gone a trifle
more slowly, she would soon have reached the same
point without exciting any anger; but now the
North felt that the queen's government had been
altogether too forward in assuming this position at
a time when the question of a real war was still in
embryo. Moreover, the unfriendliness was aggravated
by the fact that the proclamation was issued
almost at the very hour of the arrival in London
of Mr. Charles Francis Adams, the new minister
sent by Mr. Lincoln to the court of St. James.
<!-- Image No 403 --><a name='Png403'></a><a name='Page373'></a><span class="pagenum">373</span>
It seemed, therefore, not open to reasonable doubt
that Earl Russell had purposely hastened to take
his position before he could hear from the Lincoln
administration.</p>

<p>When Mr. Seward got news of this, his temper
gave way; so that, being still new to diplomacy,
he wrote a dispatch to Mr. Adams wherein occurred
words and phrases not so carefully selected
as they should have been. He carried it to Mr.
Lincoln, and soon received it back revised and
corrected, instructively. <i>A priori</i>, one would have
anticipated the converse of this.</p>

<p>The essential points of the paper were:&mdash;</p>

<p>That Mr. Adams would &quot;desist from all intercourse
whatever, unofficial as well as official, with
the British government, so long as it shall continue
intercourse of either kind with the domestic
enemies of this country.&quot;</p>

<p>That the United States had a &quot;right to expect a
more independent if not a more friendly course&quot;
than was indicated by the understanding between
England and France; but that Mr. Adams would
&quot;take no notice of that or any other alliance.&quot;</p>

<p>He was to pass by the question as to whether the
blockade must be respected in case it should not
be maintained by a competent force, and was to
state that the &quot;blockade is now, and will continue
to be, so maintained, and therefore we expect it to
be respected.&quot;</p>

<p>As to recognition of the Confederacy, either by
publishing an acknowledgment of its sovereignty,
<!-- Image No 404 --><a name='Png404'></a><a name='Page374'></a><span class="pagenum">374</span>
or officially receiving its representatives, he was
to inform the earl that &quot;no one of these proceedings
will pass unquestioned.&quot; Also, he might
suggest that &quot;a concession of belligerent rights
is liable to be construed as a recognition&quot; of the
Confederate States. Recognition, he was to say,
could be based only on the assumption that these
States were a self-sustaining power. But now,
after long forbearance, the United States having
set their forces in motion to suppress the insurrection,
&quot;the true character of the pretended new
state is at once revealed. It is seen to be a power
existing in pronunciamento only. It has never
won a field. It has obtained no forts that were
not virtually betrayed into its hands or seized in
breach of trust. It commands not a single port
on the coast, nor any highway out from its pretended
capital by land. Under these circumstances,
Great Britain is called upon to intervene, and give
it body and independence by resisting our measures
of suppression. British recognition would
be British intervention to create within our own
territory a hostile state by overthrowing this republic
itself.&quot; In Mr. Seward's draft a menacing
sentence followed these words, but Mr. Lincoln
drew his pen through it.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams was to say that the treatment of
insurgent privateers was &quot;a question exclusively
our own,&quot; and that we intended to treat them as
pirates.<a name='FNanchor_169_171'></a><a href='#Footnote_169_171'><sup>[169]</sup></a>
 If Great Britain should recognize them
<!-- Image No 405 --><a name='Png405'></a><a name='Page375'></a><span class="pagenum">375</span>
as lawful belligerents and give them shelter, &quot;the
laws of nations afford an adequate and proper
remedy;&quot;&mdash;&quot;<i>and we shall avail ourselves of it</i>,&quot;
added Mr. Seward; but again Mr. Lincoln's prudent
pen went through these words of provocation.</p>

<p>Finally Mr. Adams was instructed to offer the
adhesion of the United States to the famous Declaration
of the Congress of Paris, of 1856, which
concerned sundry matters of neutrality.</p>

<p>The letter ended with two paragraphs of that
patriotic rodomontade which seems eminently
adapted to domestic consumption in the United
States, but which, if it ever came beneath the
eye of the British minister, probably produced an
effect very different from that which was aimed at.
Mr. Lincoln had the good taste to write on the
margin: &quot;Drop all from this line to the end;&quot;
but later he was induced to permit the nonsense
to stand, since it was really harmless.</p>

<p>The amendments made by the President in point
of quantity were trifling, but in respect of importance
were very great. All that he did was here
and there to change or to omit a phrase, which
established no position, but which in the strained
state of feeling might have had serious results.
The condition calls to mind the description of the
summit of the Alleghany Ridge, where the impulses
given by almost imperceptible inequalities
<!-- Image No 406 --><a name='Png406'></a><a name='Page376'></a><span class="pagenum">376</span>
in the surface of the rock have for their ultimate
result the dispatching of mighty rivers either
through the Atlantic slope to the ocean, or down
the Mississippi valley to the Gulf of Mexico. A
few adjectives, two or three ever so little sentences,
in this dispatch, might have led to peace or to
war; and peace or war with England almost surely
meant, respectively, Union or Disunion in the
United States. In fact, no more important state
paper was issued by Mr. Seward. It established
our relations with Great Britain, and by consequence
also with France and with the rest of
Europe, during the whole period of the civil war.
Its positions, moderate in themselves, and resolutely
laid down, were never materially departed
from. The English minister did not afterward
give either official or unofficial audiences to accredited
rebel emissaries; the blockade was maintained
by a force so competent that the British
government acquiesced in it; no recognition of the
Confederacy was ever made, either in the ways
prohibited or in any way whatsoever; it is true
that bitter controversies arose concerning Confederate
privateers, and to some extent England
failed to meet our position in this matter; but it
was rather the application of our rule than the
rule itself which was in dispute; and she afterward,
under the Geneva award, made full payment
for her derelictions. The behavior and the proposal
of terms, which constituted a practical exclusion
of the United States from the benefits of the
<!-- Image No 407 --><a name='Png407'></a><a name='Page377'></a><span class="pagenum">377</span>
Treaty of Paris, certainly involved something of
indignity; but in this the country had no actual
<i>rights</i>; and to speak frankly, since she had refused
to come in when invited, she could hardly
complain of an inhospitable reception when, under
the influence of immediate and stringent self-interest,
her diplomatists saw fit to change their
course. So, on the whole, it is not to be denied
that delicate and novel business in the untried department
of foreign diplomacy was managed with
great skill, under trying circumstances. A few
months later, in his message to Congress, at the
beginning of December, 1861, the President referred
to our foreign relations in the following
paragraphs:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;The disloyal citizens of the United States, who
have offered the ruin of our country in return
for the aid and comfort which they have invoked
abroad, have received less patronage and encouragement
than they probably expected. If it were
just to suppose, as the insurgents have seemed to
assume, that foreign nations, in this case, discarding
all moral, social, and treaty obligations, would
act solely and selfishly for the speedy restoration
of commerce, including especially the acquisition
of cotton, those nations appear as yet not to have
seen their way to their object more directly or
clearly through the destruction than through the
preservation of the Union. If we could dare to
believe that foreign nations are actuated by no
higher principle than this, I am quite sure a sound
<!-- Image No 408 --><a name='Png408'></a><a name='Page378'></a><span class="pagenum">378</span>
argument could be made to show them that they
can reach their aim more readily and easily by
aiding to crush this rebellion than by giving encouragement
to it.</p>

<p>&quot;The principal lever relied on by these insurgents
for exciting foreign nations to hostility
against us, as already intimated, is the embarrassment
of commerce. Those nations, however, not
improbably saw from the first that it was the
Union which made as well our foreign as our domestic
commerce. They can scarcely have failed
to perceive that the effort for disunion produces
the existing difficulty; and that one strong nation
promises more durable peace and a more extensive,
valuable, and reliable commerce than can the same
nation broken into hostile fragments.</p>

<p>&quot;It is not my purpose to review our discussions
with foreign states; because, whatever might be
their wishes or dispositions, the integrity of our
country and the stability of our government mainly
depend not upon them but on the loyalty, virtue,
patriotism, and intelligence of the American people.
The correspondence itself with the usual reservations
is herewith submitted. I venture to hope it
will appear that we have practiced prudence and
liberality toward foreign powers, averting causes
of irritation, and with firmness maintaining our
own rights and honor.&quot;</p>

<p>While this carefully measured language certainly
fell far short of expressing indifference
concerning European action, it was equally far
<!-- Image No 409 --><a name='Png409'></a><a name='Page379'></a><span class="pagenum">379</span>
from betraying any sense of awe or dependence as
towards the great nations across the Atlantic. Yet
in fact beneath its self-contained moderation there
unquestionably was politic concealment of very
profound anxiety. Since the war did in fact maintain
to the end an entirely domestic character, it
is now difficult fully to appreciate the apprehensions
which were felt, especially in its earlier
stages, lest England or France or both might
interfere with conclusive effect in favor of the
Confederacy. It was very well for Mr. Lincoln to
state the matter in such a way that it would seem
an unworthy act upon their part to encourage a
rebellion, especially a pro-slavery rebellion; and
very well for him also to suggest that their commerce
could be better conducted with one nation
than with two. In plain fact, they were considering
nothing more lofty than their own material
interests, and upon this point their distinguished
statesmen did not feel the need of seeking information
or advice from the Western lawyer who had
just been so freakishly picked out of a frontier
town to take charge of the destinies of the United
States. The only matter which they contemplated
with some interest, and upon which they could
gather enlightenment from his words, related to
the greater or less degree of firmness and confidence
with which he was likely to meet them; for
even in their eyes this must be admitted to constitute
one of the elements in the situation. It was,
therefore, fortunate that Mr. Lincoln successfully
<!-- Image No 410 --><a name='Png410'></a><a name='Page380'></a><span class="pagenum">380</span>
avoided an appearance either of alarm or of defiance.</p>

<p>But, difficult as it may have been skillfully to
compose the sentences of the message so far as it
concerned foreign relationships, some occurrences
were taking place, at this very time of the composition,
which reduced verbal manoeuvring to insignificance.
A sudden and unexpected menace was
happily turned into a substantial aid and advantage;
and the administration, not long after it
had firmly declared its resolution to maintain its
clear and lawful rights, was given the opportunity
greatly to strengthen its position by an event
which, at first, seemed untoward enough. In the
face of very severe temptation to do otherwise, it
had the good sense to seize this opportunity, and to
show that it had upon its own part the will not
only to respect, but to construe liberally as against
itself, the rights of neutrals; also that it had the
power to enforce its will, upon the instant, even at
the cost of bitterly disappointing the whole body
of loyal citizens in the very hour of their rejoicing.</p>

<p>The story of Mason and Slidell is familiar:
accredited as envoys of the Confederacy to England
and France, in the autumn of 1861, they ran
the blockade at Charleston and came to Havana.
There they did not conceal their purpose to sail
for England, by the British royal mail steamship
Trent, on November 7. Captain Wilkes of the
United States steam sloop of war San Jacinto,
hearing all this, lay in wait in the Bahama Channel,
<!-- Image No 411 --><a name='Png411'></a><a name='Page381'></a><span class="pagenum">381</span>
sighted the Trent on November 8, fired a shot
across her bows, and brought her to. He then sent
on board a force of marines to search her and
fetch off the rebels. This was done against the
angry protests of the Englishman, and with such
slight force as constituted technical compulsion,
but without violence. The Trent was then left
to proceed on her voyage. The envoys, or &quot;missionaries,&quot;
as they were called by way of avoiding
the recognition of an official character, were soon
in confinement in Fort Warren, in Boston Harbor.
Everywhere at the North the news produced an
outburst of joy and triumph. Captain Wilkes was
the hero of the hour, and received every kind
of honor and compliment. The secretary of the
navy wrote to him a letter of congratulation, declaring
that his conduct was &quot;marked by intelligence,
ability, decision, and firmness, and has the
emphatic approval of this department.&quot; Secretary
Stanton was outspoken in his praise. When
Congress convened, on December 1, almost the
first thing done by the House of Representatives
was to hurry through a vote of thanks to the captain
for his &quot;brave, adroit, and patriotic conduct.&quot;
The newspaper press, public meetings, private
conversation throughout the country, all reechoed
these joyous sentiments. The people were in a
fever of pleasurable excitement. It called for
some nerve on the part of Mr. Lincoln and Mr.
Seward suddenly to plunge them into a chilling
bath of disappointment.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 412 --><a name='Png412'></a><a name='Page382'></a><span class="pagenum">382</span>
Statements differ as to what was Mr. Seward's
earliest opinion in the matter.<a name='FNanchor_170_172'></a><a href='#Footnote_170_172'><sup>[170]</sup></a>
 But all writers
agree that Mr. Lincoln did not move with the current
of triumph. He was scarcely even non-committal.
On the contrary, he is said at once to
have remarked that it did not look right to stop
the vessel of a friendly power on the high seas and
take passengers out of her; that he did not understand
whence Captain Wilkes derived authority to
turn his quarter-deck into a court of admiralty;
that he was afraid the captives might prove to be
white elephants on our hands; that we had fought
Great Britain on the ground of like doings upon
her part, and that now we must stick to American
principles; that, if England insisted upon our surrendering
the prisoners, we must do so, and must
apologize, and so bind her over to keep the peace
in relation to neutrals, and to admit that she had
been wrong for sixty years.</p>

<p>The English demand came quickly, forcibly,
and almost offensively. The news brought to
England by the Trent set the whole nation in a
blaze of fury,&mdash;and naturally enough, it must be
admitted. The government sent out to the navy
yards orders to make immediate preparations for
war; the newspapers were filled with abuse and
menace against the United States; the extravagance
<!-- Image No 413 --><a name='Png413'></a><a name='Page383'></a><span class="pagenum">383</span>
of their language will not be imagined
without actual reference to their pages. Lord
Palmerston hastily sketched a dispatch to Lord
Lyons, the British minister at Washington, demanding
instant reparation, but couched in language
so threatening and insolent as to make compliance
scarcely possible. Fortunately, in like
manner as Mr. Seward had taken to Mr. Lincoln
his letter of instructions to Mr. Adams, so Lord
Palmerston also felt obliged to lay his missive
before the queen, and the results in both cases
were alike; for once at least royalty did a good
turn to the American republic. Prince Albert,
ill with the disease which only a few days later
carried him to his grave, labored hard over that
important document, with the result that the royal
desire to eliminate passion sufficiently to make a
peaceable settlement possible was made unmistakably
plain, and therefore the letter, as ultimately
revised by Earl Russell, though still disagreeably
peremptory in tone, left room for the United
States to set itself right without loss of self-respect.
The most annoying feature was that Great
Britain insisted upon instant action; if Lord
Lyons did not receive a favorable reply within
seven days after formally preferring his demand
for reparation, he was to call for his passports.
In other words, delay by diplomatic correspondence
and such ordinary shilly-shallying meant war. As
the London &quot;Times&quot; expressed it, America was
not to be allowed &quot;to retain what she had taken
<!-- Image No 414 --><a name='Png414'></a><a name='Page384'></a><span class="pagenum">384</span>
from us, at the cheap price of an interminable correspondence.&quot;</p>

<p>December 19 this dispatch reached Lord Lyons;
he talked its contents over with Mr. Seward informally,
and deferred the formal communication
until the 23d. Mr. Lincoln drew up a proposal
for submission to arbitration. But it could not be
considered; the instructions to Lord Lyons gave
no time and no discretion. It was aggravating to
concede what was demanded under such pressure;
but the President, as has been said, had already expressed
his opinion upon the cardinal point,&mdash;that
England had the strength of the case. Moreover
he remarked, with good common sense, &quot;One war
at a time.&quot; So it was settled that the emissaries
must be surrendered. The &quot;prime minister of
the <i>Northern States of America</i>,&quot; as the London
&quot;Times&quot; insultingly called Mr. Seward, was wise
enough to agree; for, under the circumstances, to
allow discourtesy to induce war was unjustifiable.
On December 25 a long cabinet council was held,
and the draft of Seward's reply was accepted,
though with sore reluctance. The necessity was
cruel, but fortunately it was not humiliating; for
the President had pointed to the road of honorable
exit in those words which Mr. Lossing heard
uttered by him on the very day that the news
arrived. In 1812 the United States had fought
with England because she had insisted, and they
had denied, that she had the right to stop their
vessels on the high seas, to search them, and to
<!-- Image No 415 --><a name='Png415'></a><a name='Page385'></a><span class="pagenum">385</span>
take from them British subjects found on board
them. Mr. Seward now said that the country
still adhered to the ancient principle for which it
had once fought, and was glad to find England
renouncing her old-time error. Captain Wilkes,
not acting under instructions, had made a mistake.
If he had captured the Trent and brought
her in for adjudication as prize in our admiralty
courts, a case might have been maintained and the
prisoners held. He had refrained from this course
out of kindly consideration for the many innocent
persons to whom it would have caused serious inconvenience;
and, since England elected to stand
upon the strict rights which his humane conduct
gave to her, the United States must be bound by
their own principles at any cost to themselves.
Accordingly the &quot;envoys&quot; were handed over to
the commander of the English gunboat Rinaldo, at
Provincetown, on January 1, 1862.</p>

<p>The decision of the President and the secretary
of state was thoroughly wise. Much hung upon
it; &quot;no one,&quot; says Arnold, &quot;can calculate the results
which would have followed upon a refusal
to surrender these men.&quot; An almost certain result
would have been a war with England; and a
highly probable result would have been that erelong
France also would find pretext for hostilities,
since she was committed to friendship with England
in this matter, and moreover the emperor
seemed to have a restless desire to interfere against
the North. What then would have been the likelihood
<!-- Image No 416 --><a name='Png416'></a><a name='Page386'></a><span class="pagenum">386</span>
of ultimate success in that domestic struggle,
which, by itself, though it did not exhaust, yet
very severely taxed both Northern endurance and
Northern resources? It is fair also to these two
men to say that, in reaching their decision, instead
of receiving aid or encouragement from outside,
they had the reverse. Popular feeling may be
estimated from the utterances which, even after
there had been time for reflection, were made by
men whose positions curbed them with the grave
responsibilities of leadership. In the House of
Representatives Owen Lovejoy pledged himself to
&quot;inextinguishable hatred&quot; of Great Britain, and
promised to bequeath it as a legacy to his children;
and, while he was not engaging in the war
for the integrity of his own country, he vowed that
if a war with England should come, he would
&quot;carry a musket&quot; in it. Senator Hale, in thunderous
oratory, notified the members of the administration
that if they would &quot;not listen to the
voice of the people, they would find themselves
engulfed in a fire that would consume them like
stubble; they would be helpless before a power
that would hurl them from their places.&quot; The
great majority at the North, though perhaps incapable
of such felicity of expression, was undoubtedly
not very much misrepresented by the vindictive
representative and the exuberant senator.
Yet a brief period, in which to consider the logic
of the position, sufficed to bring nearly all to intelligent
conclusions; and then it was seen that what
<!-- Image No 417 --><a name='Png417'></a><a name='Page387'></a><span class="pagenum">387</span>
had been done had been rightly and wisely done.
There was even a sense of pride in doing fairly
and honestly, without the shuffling evasions of
diplomacy, an act of strict right; and the harder
the act the greater was the honor. The behavior
of the people was generous and intelligent, and
greatly strengthened the government in the eyes
of foreigners. By the fullness and readiness of
this reparation England was put under a moral
obligation to treat the United States as honorably
as the United States treated her. She did not do
so, it is true; but in more ways than one she ultimately
paid for not doing so. At any rate, for the
time being, after this action it would have been
nothing less than indecent for her to recognise the
Confederacy at once; and a little later prudence
had the like restraining effect. Yet though recognition
and war were avoided they never entirely
ceased to threaten, and Mr. Chittenden is perfectly
correct in saying that &quot;every act of our government
was performed under the impending danger
of a recognition of the Confederacy, a disregard of
the blockade, and the actual intervention of Great
Britain in our attempt to suppress an insurrection
upon our own territory.&quot;</p>

 An effort was made to carry out this theory in the case of the
crew of the privateer Savannah; but the jury failed to agree, and
the attempt was not afterward renewed, privateersmen being
exchanged like other prisoners of war.</p></div>

 Mr. Welles declares that Seward at first opposed the surrender;
but Mr. Chittenden asserts that he knows that Mr. Seward's
first opinion coincided with his later action; see Mr. Welles's <i>Lincoln
and Seward</i>, and Chittenden's <i>Recollections</i>, 148.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
